    This tutorial will guide you through processing a cryo tilt series without 
    fiducials, using the patch tracking method of alignment.&nbsp; The tilt series 
    is from a vitrified section and was acquired by Cedric Bouchet-Marquis.&nbsp; It 
    is recommended that you do the <a href="cryoExample.html#TOP">basic cryo 
    tutorial</a> before this one.</p>

  <p class="style1" style="text-decoration: underline">
    Getting started:</p>
      <ul>
        <LI><a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/files/cryosectionData.tar.bz">Download</a> the sample data set from our web site.</li>
        <LI>Move the data set file &quot;cryosectionData.tar.bz&quot; to the directory where you want to 
        work on it.&nbsp; Its contents will unpack into a subdirectory named &quot;cryosection&quot;.</li>
        <LI>cd to the directory with the file</li>
        <LI>Enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imoduntar cryosectionData.tar.bz<br />
          or, anywhere except on Windows without Cygwin, you can use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjf cryosectionData.tar.bz</li>
        <LI>Enter the dataset directory with:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cryosection</li>
        <LI>Start eTomo by entering
          <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etomo<br />
          and press <b>Build Tomogram</b>.</li>
      </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Tomogram setup:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press the file chooser icon on the <b>Datatset name</b> line and select the stack file.</li>
  <li>
    For <b>SystemTemplate</b>, select
    <i>cryoSample.adoc</i>. </li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Scan Header</b> </li>
  <li>
    Enter <i>0</i> for <b>Fiducial diameter</b>. Some parameters for X-ray removal 
    are set based on the fiducial size to avoid erasing fiducials, so it is 
    important to enter 0 rather than an arbitrary size when there are no fiducials. </li>
    <li>
      Select <b>Parallel Processing</b> to use multiple CPUs to compute the reconstruction, 
      or select <b>Graphics card processing</b>to use the GPU of an Nvidia card.</li>
  <li>
    In the <b>Axis A</b> group box, select <b>Series was bidirectional from</b> and set the 
    angle to <i>0</i>.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Create Com Scripts</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Pre-processing:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press <b>Create Fixed Stack</b>.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Show Min/Max for Fixed Stack</b>.&nbsp; 
    There is still a view with a maximum near 700.</li>
  <li>
    You could lower the criteria a little, but simply iterating with the 
    current criteria will work in this case and is always worth trying first.&nbsp; Do this by pressing <b>Use Fixed Stack</b> then <b>Create Fixed Stack</b> again.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Use Fixed Stack</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Coarse Alignment</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press <b>Calculate Cross-Correlation</b></li>
  <li>
    When done, press <b>Generate Coarse Aligned Stack</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Fiducial Model Generation:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        In this step, patches of image will be tracked from one view to the next, and 
        the center positions of the patches will be placed into a model file. This model 
        can be used to solve for the tilt series alignment, much as a model of true 
        fiducial markers can. </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Select <b>Use patch tracking to make fiducial model</b>.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>
      Change the <b>Size of patches(X, Y)</b> to <i>680,680</i> (if it is not already 
      set to that); this will give 4x4 
      patches.</li>
    <li>
      Press the <b>Advanced</b> button at the bottom and change the <b>High frequency 
      cutoff radius</b> to <i>0.125</i> (if it is not already set to that).&nbsp; The 
      parameters for patch tracking are mostly based on the ones for coarse alignment 
      since the same program is being run.&nbsp; However, the correlations for coarse alignment 
      are done on almost the full image and are generally binned down, so the high 
      frequency filter cutoff of 0.25 is adequate for filtering out noise.&nbsp; The patches being correlated 
      are smaller and will not be binned, so stronger filtering is needed.&nbsp; Press
      <b>Basic</b> to make it easier to see the basic controls.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Track Patches</b>. </li>
    <li>When done, press <b>Open Tracked Patches</b> to see the tracked locations on 
      the image and in Model View.&nbsp; No specific feature has been tracked, just 
      the whole patch area.&nbsp; Notice that there are just 16 contours going all the 
      way through the tilt series. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style1">
        <u>Fine Alignment:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        For this data set, the fine alignment process will involve cycling back to the 
        patch tracking page.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Press <b>Compute Alignment</b>.&nbsp; The mean residual is fairly high, 1.5 
        pixels.&nbsp; Such a high residual occurs because some of the positions tracked 
        through the patches do not correspond to projections from single points in 3D.&nbsp; 
        A better fit to the points can be gotten by breaking the contours into pieces.</li>
        <li>
          Return to the <b>Fiducial Model Generation</b> page and select <b>Break contours 
          into pieces</b>.</li>
        <li>
          Press <b>Recut or Restore Contours</b>.</li>
        <li>
          Return to the <b>Fine Alignment</b> page and press <b>Compute Alignment</b>.&nbsp; 
          The mean residual is much lower because much smaller errors build up over the 
          shorter tilt ranges in each contour.</li>
        <li>
          Press <b>View/Edit Fiducial Model</b>.&nbsp; In the Model View window, rotate 
          the model so that you can see all the tracks well by pressing the middle mouse 
          button and moving the mouse at a steep diagonal.&nbsp; Each track consists of 7 
          overlapping segments, which you can see by right-clicking near a track to select 
          a contour; only a small segment is highlighted. </li>
        <li>
          Bring up the align log file and switch to the <b>Coordinates</b> tab.&nbsp; The 
          &quot;mean resid&quot; column shows the mean residual in each contour or segment of the 
          track.&nbsp; The range is large, from 0.2 to 1.2.&nbsp; When patch tracking was 
          first developed, the approach 
          was simply to delete the contours with the highest residuals, and the Bead Fixer 
          has a <b>Look at contours</b> mode to assist this process. Not only is this somewhat 
          arbitrary, but it would lead to trouble in this case, since 10 of the highest 11 
          residuals occur for contours passing through zero degrees.&nbsp; The robust 
          fitting that is now available is a better approach.</li>
        <li>
          Turn on <b>Do robust fitting with tuning factor</b> and then turn on <b>Find 
          weights for contours, not points</b>.&nbsp; Press <b>Compute Alignment</b>.</li>
        <li>
          Open the align log again.&nbsp; Each contour has been given a weight between 0 
          and 1, where a weight of 0 means that the points in the contour are ignored in 
          the fitting.&nbsp; On the <b>Robust</b> tab, a summary line indicates 7 contours have 
          weights under 0.5.&nbsp; On the Coordinates tab, there is a new column with 
          the weights.&nbsp; The contours that have small weights are ones that have large 
          residuals relative to other comparable contours (i.e., ones at similar tilt 
          angles).</li>
        <li>
          For your own data sets with patch tracking, you will probably want to select the 
          robust fitting whenever you break contours into pieces.&nbsp; If contours are 
          not broken into pieces, there are usually too few contours to allow robust 
          fitting. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style1">
        <u>Tomogram Positioning</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        This sample can be positioned by viewing X/Z slices in the binned-down tomogram.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Set <b>Sample tomogram thickness</b> to 8<i>00</i>.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Create Whole Tomogram</b> to build a whole, binned-down tomogram.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Create Boundary Model</b> to open the tomogram</li>
      <li>
        Open a Slicer window with <b>Image-Slicer</b>.&nbsp; Set X-rotation to <i>90</i> 
        and <b>Thick: Img</b> to <i>20.</i> </li>
        <li>Draw 3 pairs of lines: in the middle of the tomogram (axis position ~380) and at axis positions near 
          115 and 555.</li>
        <li>Save the model with the S key.</li>
        <li>Press <b>Compute Z Shift &amp; Pitch Angles</b>.&nbsp; Note the large angle 
          offset, which means that the tilt angles assumed during patch tracking were 
          significantly different from the actual angles, enough to affect the 
          correlations.&nbsp; Do the following steps to incorporate this knowledge.</li>
        <li>Return to the <b>Fiducial Model Generation</b> page and press <b>Advanced</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter the angle offset from the positioning page in the <b>Tilt angle offset</b> 
          field.</li>
        <li>Press <b>Track Patches</b>.</li>
        <li>Go to the <b>Fine Alignment</b> page and do <b>Compute Alignment</b>.&nbsp; Note the 
          substantial improvement in the weighted mean residual, from ~0.41 to ~0.37. You 
          now have a final alignment that incorporates the positioning information, so you 
          can skip to creating the aligned stack.</li>
