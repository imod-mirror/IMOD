IMOD contains two kinds of distortion correction that can be applied in the
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> and 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A> programs.  One is a correction for a
fixed distortion in the imaging process at a particular magnification.  The
other is a correction for the magnification gradient involved when imaging a
tilted specimen.  In each case, calibrating the distortion requires taking
images on the microscope (preferably with SerialEM) and analyzing them in
IMOD.  For imaging distortion, this document gives some background information
and describes how to acquire the images and analyze them.  Instructions for
calibrating magnification gradients have not yet been incorporated into this
document and are available upon request.

<H2 ALIGN=center>Measuring Image Distortion Fields</H2>

<H3><A NAME = "Overlapping"></A>Estimating Distortion from Overlapping Images</H3>
<P>
To measure a distortion field at a particular magnification, you need to take
pairs of overlapping images, where only the stage is moved between the two
images of a pair.  When these images are lined up where they overlap, the
distortion field causes image movements when toggling between two images.  The
image displacement at a given point is the difference between the distortion
vectors at two different points in the field.  This means that if we measure
enough image displacements we can solve for the underlying distortion field.
To obtain a robust solution, we want to have a situation where there are about
twice as many measured displacements as unknown vectors, and where the
different measurements are somewhat independent rather than redundant.  
This can be accomplished by taking four sets of pairs, where each pair
overlaps over at least 50% of their area and the two images of a pair are
arranged horizontally, vertically, or along 45&deg; or 135&deg; diagonals.
These images are then analyzed with <A HREF = "man/finddistort.html#TOP">Finddistort</A>.
</P>
<P>
SerialEM has a procedure that will obtain such pairs (the Calibrate -
Distortion menu item).  It will work out the stage backlash, take an image,
move the stage in the desired direction, take a second image, and assess the
overlap.  If the overlap is not within a specified range, it will try again,
adjusting its local stage scaling to try to get a better result.  On an FEI
microscope,
this procedure is remarkably successful up to a magnification of about 50K with an
Ultrascan 4000 camera (1 micron field of view).  For smaller fields of view,
it is prone to fail due to imperfect and non-ideal stage behavior, and it may
require trying several times at different stage positions.
</P>
<H3><A NAME = "pairSpecimen"></A>Specimens for Distortion Pairs</H3>
<P>
The specimen for taking these paired images must be rich in image information,
because displacement will be measured in small patches, by default only 24
pixels square.  If there are significant empty areas in the image, patches in
these locations will not have enough information to give good correlations.
An ideal specimen has been prepared by Misha Sherman at University of Texas
Medical Branch, by sputter-coating gold onto standard carbon-coated grids.
The images below, from left to right, were taken with a US4000 on an F20 at
5K, 19K and 80K;
scale bars are 500, 100, and 20 nm.  At the lowest magnification there are
some larger particles as well as dense fine detail from the many small
particles; at intermediate magnification there is still a good distribution of
small dense particles in the gaps between larger ones.  At high magnification,
the gaps between particles are large enough to be a concern, but there is
sufficient structured detail from the carbon to allow the correlations to
succeed in the gaps.  The largest particles may disappear with beam exposure,
but are not needed for the image correlations to work at lower magnifications.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Sections of stained material can also be used provided
that that there is sufficient density everywhere in a field.
High-pressure-frozen, freeze-substituted material is best because it tends to
retain more detailed structure in the cytoplasm.  More extracted material may
work at low to intermediate magnifications and fail at higher magnifications
as empty areas become too large.  Large mammalian cells (for
example, T-cell lymphocytes) and tissue sections should be suitable.  Sections
of yeast cells are not optimal because they contain vacuoles and their area is
often not large enough.
The cross-line grating with gold crystals is not an adequate specimen except
at relatively low magnifications, because the areas without gold do not have
much information in them.  
</P>
<P>
The specimen does not need to be very resistant to shrinkage in the beam if
you can acquire the pairs automatically with SerialEM.  The specimen does not need to have
significant thickness (unlike the specimen needed for measuring the
stretch in the distortion field, described below).  A sputter-coated grid or a
suitable plastic section may be available upon request.
</P>
<H3><A NAME = "pairImaging"></A>Imaging Parameters for Distortion Pairs</H3>
<P>
The images themselves must be rich in high spatial-frequency information and
have relatively little noise.  In addition, the images generally do not need to be any
larger than 1024 pixels.  One approach with CCD camera images is to 
bin the images to no larger than 1024 pixels, in order to operate the
camera in its most efficient zone, and set the beam and exposure time to give
clean images with a high number of counts (e.g., > 1/2 of saturation).
However, it may be easier to get a good signal-to-noise ratio by acquiring 2K
images with higher exposure time.  With direct detectors, it is more
appropriate to acquire 2K images or even unbinned images to avoid saturation
of the 16-bit image. 
</P>
<P>The default spacing parameters for analysis in Finddistort are
tuned to 1K images.  If you do take images larger than 1K, you should either
reduce them to 1K or scale the various parameters up by the appropriate factor
(details are  given below).  There is some evidence that the latter approach may give
better fits, as long as the data have little noise.  However, there is no
filtering of the image data in Finddistort, so if the images are somewhat noisy, they
should be reduced to 1K.  Reduction can be done in 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> with binning or
with anti-aliased reduction using the "-shrink" option. If you take 4K images,
you should at least reduce them by 2.  Reduction by 4 should definitely done
with the "-shrink" option to remove aliased noise (i.e, "-shr 4").
</P>
<H3><A NAME = "rotatedPairs"></A>Measuring Stretch from 90&deg; Rotated Images</H3>
<P>
The information provided by the pairs of overlapping images can be used
to solve for a distortion field that does not contain any overall stretch.  A
stretch along one axis of 1-2% is typical for projection in an EM, and an
energy filter and camera imperfections may impose even bigger stretches.
Using a distortion field without this stretch included will not impair the
blending of overlap zones in montages, or the alignment of tilt series
(at least if the "Projection stretch" variable is included in the
alignment).  However, it will result in slightly anisotropic reconstructions.
</P>
<P>To determine the stretch in the distortion field, you need an image of
the same structure rotated by 90&deg;.  The difficulty here is that if the structure
is tilted differently in the two views, then it may be foreshortened by the
tilt and some of the stretch in the alignment transform will reflect this
foreshortening rather than the stretch in the distortion in field.  Although
this effect is a small one because the cosine is very close to 1 near 0&deg;, it
is possible to control for it.  The solution is to take a small tilt series of
a specimen that has some distribution of features in depth, before and after
rotating by 90&deg;.  The pairs of views from the two series that match
the best will be the closest to being tilted the same in the two orientations,
and will give the best estimate of the stretching due to rotating in the
distortion field. <A HREF = "man/matchrotpairs.html#TOP">Matchrotpairs</A> 
is used to find the best matching pair of images.
</P>
<P>
The tilt series should be at 1.5&deg; intervals between -4.5&deg; and 4.5&deg;.
The tilt series does not need to be very well aligned; the simple
macro given below is adequate for acquiring it.  The rotation does not need to
be exactly 90&deg; (80&deg; is good enough).  Images 1K in size are adequate. 
</P>
<P>The most important thing is to get a pair of images before and after the
90&deg; rotation.  Being able to refine the estimate by controlling for tilt
is secondary; in the extreme case, a tilt of 4&deg; will make the estimate of
stretch be off by 0.0024.
</P>
<H3><A NAME = "rotatedSpecimen"></A>Specimens for 90&deg; Rotated Images</H3>
<P>
The challenges in this measurement are in finding the same area after 90
degree rotation, preventing excessive shrinkage between the first and second
setes of images, and having enough 3D information to allow the best set of
corresponding views to be found.
Three kinds of specimens are suitable: plastic sections with thickness of
at least 150-200 nm, the standard cross-line replica grating with latex
spheres, and colloidal gold placed rather densley on both sides of a thick
film.  Each has different considerations:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
For plastic sections, it should be easy to locate the same area and there
should be adequate 3D information.
To minimize shrinkage, it is important to irradiate the chosen
area for a long time (at least 5 minutes), and to avoid exposing it to a
much additional dose while rotating and repositioning.  Some degree of uniform
shrinkage can be tolerated since the analysis will separate an overall mag
change from the stretch in the alignment transformation.  </LI>
<LI>
For the cross-line grating, an area with many latex spheres should be chosen
to give enough information about features at different depths.  A clump of
spheres will serve this purpose as well as provide a feature that is easy to
locate after rotation.  Try to find a clump with as many spheres as in the
example below.  If you do not have a rotating holder, pick one of the
grid squares around the center of the grid if possible, so that the area can
be found again without too much trouble.  The latex beads should probably be
irradiated somewhat but no special precautions are needed thereafter. </LI>
<LI>
With gold on a film, the main issue is getting a thick enough film.  Doing the
analysis with a standard carbon film is troublesome and tedious because the
separation between surfaces is so small.  Based on experience with a 30-nm
film, it seems that a film of at least 60 nm thickness would be needed to make
the analysis work as easily as for other samples.  A finder gird should be
used to make it possible to locate the area after rotation.</LI>

<H3><A NAME = "dpAnalyze"></A>Initial Analysis of Distortion Pairs</H3>
<P>
The analysis proceeds in three stages.  First you use 
<A HREF = "man/finddistort.html#TOP">Finddistort</A> to get a
stretch-free distortion field.  Then you use 
<A HREF = "man/matchrotpairs.html#TOP">Matchrotpairs</A> to analyze the
rotated images and get a transformation that provides information about the
stretch.  Finally, you rerun 
<A HREF = "man/finddistort.html#TOP">Finddistort</A> with this transformation to get the
true distortion field.
</P>
<P>
If you do not have 1K images, you need to increase four parameters proportionally
from their defaults. The parameters are the spacing between correlated boxes
("-grid", default 16), the spacing between values used to solve the linear
equations ("-data", default 20), the spacing between values in the distortion
field file ("-field", default 40), and the size of the correlated boxes, which
is normally the only parameter that is varied ("-box", default 24).  Thus, for
2K images, you should add "-gri 32 -dat 40 -fie 80" to all of the Finddistort
commands given below, plus either "-box 48" or double the recommended increase
in box size.
</P>
<P>
Analyze a stack of distortion pairs with: 
<pre>
   finddistort -bin 4 -pat dp18K.mrc 18K
</pre>
The binning must be specified with the "-bin" parameter.  It should be the final
binning, the product of the binning on the camera and any reduction applied to
the images.  The "-pat" parameter
makes the program output a .patch file that can be converted to an IMOD model
with <A HREF = "man/patch2imod.html#TOP">Patch2imod</A>. 
The input file is the file of distortion pairs for one mag,
and the last entry is a root name for a variety of output files.
</P>
<P>
When you run this you will see output for each iteration such as:
<pre>
Shift changes:   0.30   0.24   0.06   0.18  -0.28   0.15  -0.33  -0.03
 iteration 2   mean change in shift  0.314042598
 5436 rows of data, 43718 entries
 condition #  851.695984  874.654541
 Mean and max residual in fit:   0.163  0.532
 Mean and max change in field:    0.0157   0.0648
</pre>
The first line shows how much the shifts used to align the overlapping images 
changed between iterations, and the second line shows the mean change.
<br>
The third line indicates the size of the data matrix on this iteration.
<br>
The fourth line gives condition numbers indicating how suitable the data are
for linear solution.
<br>
The mean and maximum residual of the fit indicate the reliability of the
solution.
<br>
The final line shows the mean and maximum change in the distortion field from
the previous iteration to this one.  Both these changes and the changes in
shifts will go to zero unless something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
If the maximum residual is higher than 1 (or ~1.7 for 2K images), you should
increase the box size from its default of 24.  Try 32, and if the error is
still high, try 40 (64 and 80 for 2K images).  With
these larger box sizes, reduce the indent to 2; i.e., add the arguments
"-box 32 -ind 2".
</P>
<P>
You can check how well the initial shifts were determined with:
<pre>
   midas -b 0 dp18K.mrc 18K.rawxf
</pre>
All of the pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8) should look as well aligned as possible,
but when you toggle between them you will see the effects of the distortion
field.
</P>
<P>
You can see how well these images match after distortion correction with:
<pre>
   midas -b 0 dp18K.udst 18K.udxf
</pre>
The pairs should match very well.
</P>
<P>
You can visualize the distortion field by converting the patch file to a model:
<pre>
   patch2imod -f 18K.patch 18K.mod
   3dmodv 18K.mod
</pre>
If the vectors are too long and overlap too much, add the option "-s 5" to set
the scaling to 5 instead of 10 in the 
<A HREF = "man/patch2imod.html#TOP">Patch2imod</A> command.  If you open the
model with <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> instead of 3dmodv, the
vectors will be displayed with
arrowheads in the Zap window.  A good set of vectors should change relatively
smoothly between adjacent positions and not have wild vectors.  Here is an example:

<H3><A NAME = "tsAnalyze"></A>Analysis of Rotated Tilt Series</H3>
<P>
The second step is to analyze the rotated images.  If you used a plastic
section or a cross-line grating with enough depth information, this step is 
easy:
<pre>
   matchrotpairs -d 18K.nosidf -b 4 18Kts1.mrc 18Kts2.mrc rp18K.xf
</pre>
Here you provide the no-stretch distortion field, specify the binning of the
images again, and give the names of the tilt series files and an output file
for a transform.
</P>
<P>
You will see a difference measure for every possible pair, with a star as each
new minimum is reached, and at the end the pair that gives the best match will
be listed.  All of the differences should be somewhat low at the proper
rotation angle and much higher at the wrong angle.  You can visualize the
quality of the fit between the best pair with
<pre>
   midas -b 0 rp18K.stack rp18K.xf
</pre>
</P>
<P>
If the fit is poor, or if you have anomalously high differences at the proper
rotation angle, rerun <A HREF = "man/matchrotpairs.html#TOP">Matchrotpairs</A> 
with "-m" to run Midas and set the initial
alignment.  Also, prior to IMOD 4.8.27, it
might be necessary to run Midas to set the rotation angle if it is not within ~5
degrees of 90.  
This time you can add "-a" and the rotation angle determined from
the first run (+90 or -90).  <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> 
will open up with the central image from
each tilt series.  Use shift and rotation to align the images.  Save the
transforms and exit <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>.
All pairs will then be analyzed with this
alignment as an initial alignment.  If 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> opens twice due to a bug in the
new version of <A HREF = "man/matchrotpairs.html#TOP">Matchrotpairs</A> 
(IMOD 4.8.27 - 4.8.37), you can prevent this with
the option "-mirror -1".
</P>
<P>
If the procedure seems not to have found the best pair, it is possible to
check the pairs manually.  First rerun 
<A HREF = "man/matchrotpairs.html#TOP">Matchrotpairs</A> with the "-x" option to
have it output all of the transformations to a set of files, one for each
section in the second tilt series.  You must include either the "-a" or the
"-m" option to get this output.  You can use "-za" and "-zb" to run on a subset of
the sections, but if so always start from section 1 to avoid confusion about
which sections are being referred to.  For example:
<pre>
   matchrotpairs -za 1,5 -zb 1,5 -a 90 -x -d 18K.nosidf -b 4 18Kts1.st 18Kts2.st rp18K.xf
</pre>
will produce a set of 5 transform files, rp18K-1.xf, rp18K-2.xf, etc, that
contain the transforms for aligning each of the sections in the first series
to section 1, section 2, etc in the second series.
</P>
<P>
You also need undistorted stacks:
<pre>
   newstack -ima 4 -dis 18K.nosidf -sec 0-4 18kts1.mrc 18kts1.udst
   newstack -ima 4 -dis 18K.nosidf -sec 0-4 18kts2.mrc 18kts2.udst
</pre>
where "-ima" specifies the existing binning of the data. Then you can run:
<pre>
    midas -b 0 -r 18Kts2.udst 18Kts1.udst rp18K-1.xf
</pre>
</P>
<P>
When this starts, you can assess the match between each section of ts1 with
section 1 of ts2.  To compare with the next section, use the menu entry
File - Load transforms and select rp18K-2.xf.  Then make the reference section
be 2 and you should see aligned image pairs again.  In general, make the
number of the reference section match the number of the transform file.  In
this way, you can compare all pairs if necessary and find the best match.
Finally, rerun Matchrotpairs without the -x option and specifying the best 
pair of sections.  For example, if the best reference section is 2 and the
best current section is 4, enter "-za 4,4 -zb 2,2".
</P>
<H3><A NAME = "dpFinal"></A>Final Analysis of Distortion Pairs with Stretch Included</H3>
<P>
Once you have the rotation pair transform, you rerun 
<A HREF = "man/finddistort.html#TOP">Finddistort</A>:
<pre>
   finddistort -bin 4 -pat -usexf -str rp18K.xf dp18K.st 18K
</pre>
The "-usexf" tells it to use the existing raw transforms on the first round, and
"-str rp18K.xf" tells it to derive the stretch from the transformation file.  Be
sure to add "-box", "-ind", and other parameters that you used on the last
initial run.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this run you will see a lot of output about the stretch
transformation:
<pre>
Pair has rotation =   90.02, mag = 1.0171, stretch = 0.9625 on   76.3 deg axis
Mean mag = 0.9978, using mag = 1.0193 and stretch = 0.9625
 No-mag transformation:  0.008361 -0.983182  1.017184 -0.009197
</pre>
These lines describe the transformation between the rotated images in terms of
a rotation, magnification, and stretch.  If the mean mag is not 1.0, then the
transform is scaled up to have a mean mag of 1.0 by increasing its mag
component.  The result is a no-mag transformation that can then be assumed to
be the result of the same underlying stretch in the two images.
<pre>
True rotation =   90.02, underlying stretch =  1.0096 on   76.4 deg axis
 Stretch transformation:  0.991546  0.004387  0.004387  1.008546
</pre>
These lines describe the underlying stretch transformation that must be added
to the distortion field.
<pre>
 Implied no-mag transformation:  0.008356 -0.983182  1.017184 -0.009192
</pre>
The stretch implies a transformation between rotated images, which should
match the no-mag transform given above.
<pre>
 Embedded transformation:  0.991543  0.004386  0.004386  1.008542
</pre>
After adding the stretch into the distortion field, the field is analyzed to
determine the net stretch transformation that has been embedded in the field,
which should closely match the solved stretch transformation above.

The final distortion field is in the file with extension ".idf".  Rename such
files if desired to provide whatever information users need to identify it (e.g., the date
or the camera).  In order for eTomo to find the files, place them in a
subdirectory named "Distortion" of the
directory pointed to by the IMOD_CALIB_DIR environment variable.  By default
this directory is /usr/local/ImodCalib except on Windows systems without Cygwin, where
it is C:\ProgramData\IMOD.
