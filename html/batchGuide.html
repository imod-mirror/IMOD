<P>
  Etomo provides an interface for reconstructing multiple tomograms
  automatically using
  <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A>.  The data sets
  should be sufficiently similar so that, for the most part, the same
  parameters and procedures can
  be applied to all of them.  The 
  interface allows you to set a number of parameters, but in each case a
  different value can be used for individual dataset.  The parameters that we
  think most likely to vary are included in a table of datasets.  For the
  other parameters, there is one tab of the interface to set the values to
  apply in general, which are referred to as global values.  If necessary, you
  can open a copy of this screen for an individual dataset and set
  different values there.
  <P> For simplicity, this interface presents a selected subset of the many
  parameters that can
  be set from the regular reconstruction interface.  For now, we are relying
  on templates as a mechanism for controlling the values of parameters not
  exposed in the interface.  Templates and the current editor for saving them
  are described in <A HREF = "usingEtomo#Templates">Using eTomo</A>.  In
  brief, they are text files with the extension ".adoc" containing name-value
    pairs called directives, whose format is described in the
    <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A> man page.  The
    available directives are listed in the <A HREF =
    "directives.html#TOP">directive table</A>.  If you want to make a template
    for personal use and do so by hand, put it in the directory
    .etomotemplates under your home directory (this is where eTomo's template
    editor places user templates by default).  <A HREF =
    "UsingEtomo.html#Templates">Using eTomo</A> describes what to do with templates
    for general use.  The plan is for there to be an <B>Advanced</B> button
    that will open a full directive editor with all possible choices.
    <P> The interface is organized into four tabs that would generally be
    visited in sequence from left to right.  However, they can all be accessed
    and changed at any time.  Also note that you can close the interface and
    reopen it to resume working on a project; you should find all of the
    settings as you left them, although a few may no longer be changed.  The
    project file has the extension ".ebt".
    <P> <B>Current Capabilities</B>.&nbsp; This interface and, to a lesser extent,
      the batch processing capability itself are still under development; the
      <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A> man page is the
      definitive source for what can be run.  When you get a new version of
      IMOD, check this paragraph for news about the current capabilities.  In
      the initial release of this
      interface, dual axis datasets will be run to completion if possible.
      This is great if it works, but if you do open the Tomogram Combination
      interface, it will overwrite the final parameters from the automated
      processing.  It is now our highest priority to resolve this conflict and
      update the Combine interface with new options for automated combining
      compatible.

<H3><A NAME = "BatchSetup"></A>Setting General Batch Processing
  Parameters</H3>
<P>
  The <B>Batch Setup</B> tab has items that should be filled in first.
  <UL>
    <LI> <B>Move dataset to</B>.&nbsp;  This item allows you to move datasets from
      their current locations into another location where each will be given
      its own directory for processing.  With this
      option, when
      <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A> starts processing
      a dataset, it creates a directory for it under the indicated location,
      with the root name of the dataset, and moves the 
      raw stack(s) there, as well as any associated files (".mdoc", ".rawtlt",
      and ".log").  This is ideal for 
      handling stacks that have been transferred to a single location after
      being acquired, but in fact the datasets can be in multiple locations.
      After you turn on the checkbox, you can select a directory to which the
      datasets will be delivered.
    <LI> <B>Starting directive file</B>.&nbsp; You can initialize the global
      parameters for these dataset with a directive file from previous batch
      processing.  This provides an alternative to making a template file from
      a similar dataset.
    <LI> <B>Templates</B>.&nbsp; Templates can be selected just as in the
      reconstruction setup page.  If you do not have a starting directive file,
      these selections are initialized with the defaults that can be chosen in
      the Options-Settings dialog.  With a starting directive file, the
      template entries in that file, if any, are used to initialize these
      entries. Select one of the stock system templates in order to activate
      the Sobel filter centering during bead tracking with an appropriate
      smoothing parameter.  The template entries are shown blue because
      parameters in the <B>Dataset Values</B> that are derived from a
      template are also shown in blue.
    <LI> <B>Project Name and Location</B>.&nbsp; The project files consist of the
      command file for running
      <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A>, the eTomo project
      file, and a directive file with global settings.  They will be named
      with the <B>root name</B> shown in the box.  The default name was
      designed to be reasonably
      unique as well as fairly interpretable (the 6 digits after the date
      are hours, minutes, seconds without any colons), bt you are free to
      change it.  The <B>Location</B> is initialized to the directory from
      which you started eTomo, but another location can be selected.
  </UL>
  
  </P>
<H3><A NAME = "Stacks"></A>The Stack Table</H3>
<P>
  On the <B>Stacks</B>, you add the tilt series that you want to process to a
  table.  When you press <B>Add Stack(s)</B>, a file chooser will open to
  allow you to select the stack files.  You can select multiple files and add
  them together.  If you have many dual-axis data sets, you can select all of
  the "a" and "b" files together, and the program will show just the "a" files
  in the table.  The stacks can have an extension of either ".st" or ".mrc";
  the latter will be renamed to ".st" for processing.
  <P> For your first addition to the table, the <B>Dual
  axis</B>, <B>Montage</B>, and <B>Beads on Two Surfaces</B> checkboxes are
  set based on the defaults that you have set in the Options-Settings dialog,
  as modified by any templates you have chosen.  The setting for 
  <B>Dual Axis</B> box will also be modified as appropriate when both "a" and
  "b" stacks are entered, or when the stack root name does not end in "a" or
  "b".  Further entries will inherit the settings of these three boxes from
  the previous line in the table.  The <B>Copy Down</B> button will copy these
  three settings from the selected line to the one below, which is fairly
  useless and will be changed to copy to all lines below.  Until then, the
  easiest way to get these boxes set for a large number of datasets is to add
  one, set the buttons, then add the rest.
  <P> The <B>Boundary Model</B> is used to indicate regions where the fiducial
    seed model should be selected for tracking.  If you have
    datasets needing such models, check the box before pressing the 3dmod icon
    to draw the model, so that 3dmod can be given the right filename and
    location.  The file is named with the dataset root name plus
    "_rawbound.mod" and is placed in the current location of the dataset.  For
    a dual-axis dataset, the model is transformed to be used with the second
    axis. You need to draw one or more contours just on one view, the
    zero-degree one if possible.
  <P> If entries are made to <B>Exclude Views</B>, the views will
    currently be carried through into the coarse and fine aligned stacks but
    skipped in tracking, alignment and reconstruction.
  </P>
  <H3><A NAME = "SetValues"></A>Setting Parameters for the Datasets</H3>
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI> <B>Distortion Corrections</B>.&nbsp; You can select an image distortion field
      file and a magnification gradient file if you have those distortion
      corrections available.  If you have data from SerialEM, the binning will
      be detected when the header is scanned.  Otherwise, if you have data with
      a binning other than 1, you would need to have a directive in a template
      file (e.g., "setupset.copyarg.binning = 2").
    <LI> <B>X-ray Removal</B>.&nbsp;  Removal of X-rays and other extreme artifacts
      will be done if <B>Remove X-rays</B> is selected.  The raw stack will be
      "archived" automatically with
      <A HREF = "man/archiveorig.html#TOP">Archiveorig</A>.  If you have
      large artifacts present on every section, you can select an existing
      <B>Manual replacement model</B> to erase them.  Or, you can
      press <B>Make in 3dmod</b> and make such a model on the first dataset.
      The convention in these models is that object 1 should have patches in
      which each pixel has a model point, object 2 should have lines to
      remove, and object 3 should have patches defined by boundary contours.
      In any case, the model will be copied into each of the datasets from
      where it exists.
    <LI> <B>Alignment Method and Tracking Parameters</B>.&nbsp; All of the alignment
      methods available in eTomo can be run with automation.  However, for a
      dual-axis
      set, combination will be done automatically only for the <B>Autoseed and
      track</B> method.  With that method, the seed model for the second axis
      will be done by first running
      <A HREF = "man/transferfid.html#TOP">Transferfid </A> then using
       <A HREF = "man/auotfidseed.html#TOP">Autofidseed</A> to add points to
       the model, which is useful if there is a significant shift between the
       two axes.  Local tracking is done by default. If you use patch
       tracking and break contours into pieces, the pieces will have the
       default length that is used in eTomo based on the number of views.
       There is no entry for binning the prealigned stack; to do this, you
       would need a template entry such as
       "comparam.prenewst.newstack.BinByFactor = 2" or
       "comparam.preblend.blendmont.BinByFactor".   With direct detectors,
       especially K2 in counting mode, you may want anti=aliased reduction,
       and this would also require a template entry
       "comparam.prenewst.newstack.AntialiasFilter = -1".  Similarly,
       antialiased reduction for the final aligned stack would require
       "comparam.newst.newstack.AntialiasFilter = -1".
       <LI> <B>Alignment</B>.&nbsp; Robust fitting is used in all cases in
       <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html#TOP">Tiltalign</A> with the default
       tuning factor of 1.  A template entry such as
       "comparam.align.tiltalign.KFactorScaling = 0.9" could be used for more
       aggressive downweighting of outlying points.
       The only parameters that can be set here are
       whether to use local alignments and whether to enable solving
       for distortion (X-stretching).  The program will not allow the latter
       unless gold is actually found to be on two surfaces in reasonable
       amounts.  The new script
       <A HREF = "man/restrictalign.html#TOP">Restrictalign</A> will be called
       to reduce the alignment parameters automatically in order to maintain a
       minumum and/or target ratio of measurements to unknowns.  There are
       directives to control that process if necessary.  Other than this, the
       one template entry that might be needed for alignment would be to
       enable the beam tilt solution with
       "comparam.align.tiltalign.BeamTiltOption = 2".
    <LI> <B>CTF Correction</B>.&nbsp; CTF correction can be done with fitting in
      <A HREF = "man/ctfplotter.html#TOP">Ctfplotter</A> to all individual
      images or to a series of blocks of images.  For the latter,
      select <B>Autofit range</B> and fill in entries for the range of angles
      to fit and the angular step between ranges (e.g., 20 and 10 to fit
      blocks of views over 20 degrees with 10 degree steps between the
      blocks).  You must fill in the range and step when using this option,
      and the <B>Defocus</B> box with the expected defocus in all cases.
    <LI> <B>Reconstruction</B>.&nbsp; The tomogram can be built with
      back-projection or with SIRT, or both.  For SIRT, indicate a list of
      iterations to leave, or more likely just a single number for the number
      of iterations.  There are three choices for specifying the tomogram
      thickness, one by total unbinned pixels, one by binned pixels, and one to
      use a calculated value plus a specified margin.  The latter will use a
      specified thickness as the fallback if there is no calculated thickness
      available or if it is too much smaller than the fallback.  This option is
      the default because it is the most general-purpose.  Currently, the
      calculated value is simply based on the distance between gold on two
      surfaces, but soon it will be possible to use automatic positioning for
      plastic sections.
    <LI> <B>Dataset Table for Specific Values</B>.&nbsp; The simple table at the
      bottom has a button with which you can open a parameter value dialog for
      a single dataset.  When you press <B>Open</B>, that dataset will be given
      a copy of the current parameters, and after that point, its values are
      separate and unaffected by any further changes in the global values.  You
      can revert to global values in the standalone dialog, and that will
      discard any special values that you set.
  </UL>
  </P>

<H3><A NAME = "Run"></A>Saving and Running Files</H3>
<P>
  When you select the <B>Run</B> tab, a table appears at the top with
  computing resources.  This will show avalable CPUs on the left, and
  if <B>Parallel GPUs</B> is selected, it will show available GPU's on the
  right.  Your selections determine what resources are used for each single
  reconstruction.  Reconstructions are run sequentially, not in parallel with
  each other.  If you enable <B>Email notification</B> and enter an address,
  <A HREF = "man/batchruntomo.html#TOP">Batchruntomo</A> will send an email
  whenever a dataset is aborted and when all processing is complete.
<P>
  After you press <B>Save Batch Files</B>, you will find the command file in
  the project directory, named "rootname.com", where "rootname" is the project
  root name from the <B>Batch Setup</B> tab.  Simply execute this with:
  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; subm rootname</code>
  <br>The eTomo project log window will have two command lines, one for
  changing to that directory and one for running the job; you should be able
  to copy and paste these into the terminal.
<P>
  There are two ways to kill the operation: 1) In the project directory, enter
  the command:
  <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; echo Q > rootname.cmds</code>
  <br>where agin you substitute the project root name for "rootname". 2) In
  the same terminal where you gave the "subm" command, enter "fg" to bring the
  background process to the foreground, then press Ctrl-C (this will not work
  in Windows without Cygwin). Both of these methods allow Batchruntomo to stop
  all running processes.
<P>
  The log file created in the project directory will contain all of the log
  output from the run, but there will be a copy of the portion of that log for
  each dataset in its respective directory.
