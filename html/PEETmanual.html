<h3><a NAME="Introduction to PEET"></a>1. Introduction to PEET</h3>

<p>PEET is a set of programs, separate from but typically used in
conjunction with IMOD, to align and average
particles / subvolumes extracted from 3D volumes.&nbsp;  It iteratively refines
particle alignments against a reference volume over several iterations.&nbsp;
A new reference is typically generated from a subset of the aligned 
particles at the end of each iteration for use in the following iteration.
IMOD's <a href="man/etomo.html#TOP">eTomo</a> graphical user interface 
permits  users to set up options (search parameters, etc.), 
and to control the execution of the process.&nbsp;  This guide will explain
the use of that interface.&nbsp; 
For details on individual PEET
programs, please consult the program descriptions and manual pages
accessible from the eTomo's Help Menu, by running "PEETHelp",
or online at
<a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/PEET/man/html/index.html">
bio3d.colorado.edu</a>.&nbsp;
Manual pages are also available at a shell prompt using the "man" 
command.&nbsp; (Program descriptions and manual pages will only be available
locally on systems with PEET already installed).</p>

<p>Each PEET project must reside in its own directory because of the  potentially large 
number of intermediate and output files created.&nbsp; Input files (IMOD models and
volumes, initial motive lists, etc.) can also reside in this directory, but are not 
required to.</p>

<p>To access the interface and create a new PEET project, run eTomo and either press the
<b>New PEET</b> button, or select <b>File</b>--><b>New</b>--><b>PEET</b> from the
menu.&nbsp; This will bring up a dialog allowing you to specify the directory where the
new project is to be located, as well as a base or root name to be used in generating 
output and intermediate file names.&nbsp; This dialog will also allow you to copy all the
settings from an existing project as a starting point for the new one.&nbsp</p>

<p>Alternatively, to open an existing PEET project
simply cd to the desired directory and run eTomo with the name of the desired project
file, e.g. "eTomo myProject.epe", or run eTomo with no arguments and select 
 <b>File</b>--><b>Open</b>--><b>PEET</b> from the
menu.&nbsp; You can then browse to and select the desired project file.&nbsp; 
(PEET project files have a .epe suffix, as described below).</p> 

<p> The eTomo PEET gui has 2 tabs, labeled <b>Setup</b> and <b>Run</b>.&nbsp;  
The <b>Setup</b> tab has options for defining the data to
be worked on and setting up initial conditions and other features of
the search.&nbsp;  The <b>Run</b> tab has a table for entering
parameters to control each iteration of the search and options for
the final averaging operation.</p>

<H3><A NAME="The Setup Tab"></A>2. The Setup Tab</H3>

<H4><A NAME="Root Name for Output"></A>2.1. Root Name for Output</H4>

<p>(Read only). Displays the base name that PEET will use to create output and intermediate
files.&nbsp; In the following examples, we will assume a base name of "myRun". 
</p>

<H4><A NAME="Directory Field"></A>2.2. Directory</H4>

<p>(Read only). Displays the directory containing the PEET project.</p>

<p>Assuming a base name of "myRun", some of the important text files in
this directory are listed in the table below,&nbsp; 
(Here, #k and #m stand for integers, and "*" 
is a wildcard which can match any series of characters.)</p>

<p>Optimal alignments found for tomogram #k particles during
alignment iteration #m - 1.&nbsp;  PEET uses the contents as 
inputs subject to further refinement in iteration #m.&nbsp;  
These files are in "comma separated value" (.csv) format, so they
can be examined or modified in text editors or in spreadsheet 
programs like Excel or
OpenOffice Calc.&nbsp; "MOTL" stands for
motive list, a set of rotations, translations, and other

</TABLE>
<br>

<p>Files with .mrc extension in this folder are volumes stored
in MRC format.&nbsp; References and final averages created by PEET 
are important examples.&nbsp;  
For example, myRun_Ref#m.mrc is the reference volume created for 
alignment during iteration #m.&nbsp; Similarly, the average volume 
resulting from combining #n particles at iteration #m is stored in 
myRun_AvgVol_#mP#n.mrc.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Volume Table"></A>2.3. Volume Table</H4>

<p>The Volume Table can have multiple rows, each referring to a volume
and corresponding model to be included in the alignment.&nbsp;
A row can be selected by clicking <b>=&gt;</b> near the left end of the
row.&nbsp;
Each row can contain 5 entries, described in the following table.&nbsp;</p>

<TABLE WIDTH=639 BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR="#000000" CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=0>

<COL WIDTH=461>
<TR>

<TD WIDTH=148>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Volume</p>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=461 VALIGN=TOP>
<p>The name of a file containing a tomogram in MRC format,
typically oriented so that X / Y planes correspond to slices of the
specimen.&nbsp;  (Post-processing may be
necessary after reconstruction achieve this orientation.)&nbsp;
The same volume can be entered on more than one row.</p>
</TD>

</TR>
<TR>

<TD WIDTH=148>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Model</p>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=461 VALIGN=TOP>
<p>The name of a file containing an IMOD model for the
current volume.&nbsp;  All points in the first
object of the model, and only those points, will be used, with  
each point specifying the center
of a particle to be aligned and averaged.&nbsp;  
(Points in objects other than the first can be useful for specifying
orientation in some cases.&nbsp; See 
<a HREF="Particle Y Axis Section"2.9>Particle Y Axis Section</a> below,
in addition to the man pages for PEET programs modTwist2EM, spikeInit and stalkInit.)&nbsp;
Typically, the object will contain either scattered points for 
isolated particles or open contours if the particles lie 
along filaments, and will be assigned the corresponding type.</p>
</TD>

</TR>
<TR>

<TD WIDTH=148>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Initial MOTL</p>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=461 VALIGN=TOP>
<p>The name of a file containing an initial motive list, specifying
rotations and / or translations required to approximately align each 
particle with the reference.&nbsp; This can permit use of a more restricted
search for the optimal alignment.&nbsp;  The file format is identical to
that of the .csv MOTL files used by PEET to transfer alignment 
information between
iterations.&nbsp; This parameter is active only if the  
<b>User supplied csv files</b> option is selected in the 
"Initial Motive List" section, described below.</p>
</TD>

</TR>
<TR>

<TD WIDTH=148>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Tilt Range</p>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=461 VALIGN=TOP>
<p>Two values defining the tilt range used to collect the tomogram. Tilt range 
is used to correct averages and alignments for the effects of 
the tomographic "missing wedge".&nbsp;  This option is disabled by 
default.&nbsp; 
To enable it, check <b>Enabled</b> under "Missing
Wedge Compensation".&nbsp; If you have a tilt file containing the tilt
angles for the currently selected tomogram,
you can read the appropriate values from the
file by pressing the <b>Read Tilt File</b> button beneath
the table.&nbsp; 
The default type of file is a "tilt.log", whose angles should
always be correct.&nbsp;
You can also change the filter in the file chooser to select a ".tlt" file,
whose angles will be correct as long as the no additional angle offset was
entered when running IMOD's Tilt program.&nbsp;
Tilt range must be specified in order to use missing 
wedge compensation.</p>

<p>If 2 or more tilt axes are in use (see 
<a HREF="#Missing Wedge Compensation Section">2.7. Missing Wedge Compensation Section</a>), 
Tilt Range will be replaced by a single column labeled "Missing Wedge Mask".&nbsp; 
This field should contain the name of a file containing the missing data mask(s)
for this row of the volume table.&nbsp;</p> 

</TD>

</TR>
<TR>

</TABLE>
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="Action Buttons"></A>2.4. Action Buttons</H4>

<p><b>Up</b>, <b>Down</b>, <b>Delete</b>, and <b>Dup</b> buttons to the right of the volume table allow
modifying the volume table by moving, deleting, or duplicating a selected existing 
row.&nbsp; To select a row press <b>=></b> near the left of the row. The <b>Insert</b> button
adds a new, blank row a the bottom of the volume table. Volume, Model, and
Initial MOTL fields for any row in the volue table can be entered or modified either
by selecting the file browser (folder) icon to the right of the field, or by typing
directly in the text box.&nbsp; Tilt ranges can be entered or modified by typing in
the appropriate text box, or by pressing <b>Read tilt file</b> if you have the an
appropriate file.&nbsp; Selecting a row of the volume table and pressing 
<b>Open in 3dmod</b> will open and display the corresponding volume,
assuming it is the name of a single volume.&nbsp; If <b>File names are
templates</b> is selected, any or all of Volume, Model, Initial MOTL, and
Missing Wedge Mask can be templates mapping to many files, rather than
the name of a single file. For example v1-60.mrc would be expanded to
60 volumes: v1.mrc, v2.mrc, ... v60.mrc.&nbsp;</p>

<H4><A NAME="Reference Section"></A>2.5. Reference Section</H4>

<p>The Reference section allows specification of the  initial reference to be used
for the first alignment iteration. If the <b>Particle</b> radio button is pressed, a single,
specified particle from one of the input volumes will be used as the initial 
reference.&nbsp; Tomograms and particles are both numbered sequentially from 1, and
particles are numbered as if all the contours were combined into one; e.g. if the 
first contour has 100 particles, then the 20th particle of the second contour will
be particle number 120.&nbsp; Note that PEET will align and average only particles 
and contours contained in the object 1.&nbsp; Additional objects will be ignored during
alignment and averaging, although they are used by some specific PEET programs
(e.g. see the man pages for modTwist2EM, spikeInit, and stalkInit). </p>

<p>If <b>User supplied file</b> is selected, the specified MRC file will be used as the
initial reference. In this case, the user is responsible for ensuring that the supplied
reference is appropriately sized.&nbsp; To support full searches, the
reference should ideally be a cube large enough to contain a particle in any orientation,
padded by twice the maximum search distance in any orientation.&nbsp; 
(PEET will choose an adequate reference size automatically when the reference
is not user-supplied).</p>

<p>Finally, if <b>Multiparticle reference</b> is selected the specified number 
(a power of 2 between 4 and 1024 chosen from the drop-down box) of randomly chosen
particles will be aligned and combined using a binary tree structure, and the resulting
average used as the initial reference.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Volume Size"></A>2.6. Volume Size</H4>

<p>Specifies the size in voxels of the subvolumes to be aligned and averaged.&nbsp;
Cubical volumes are prefered when possible, although they are not required.&nbsp;
NOTE: since PEET version 1.9.0 it is no longer necessary nor desirable 
that volume size be padded by twice the maximum Search Distance. Volume
size should now be set only slightly larger than the volume of interest.

<H4><A NAME="Missing Wedge Compensation Section"></A>2.7. Missing Wedge Compensation Section</H4>

<p>Check <b>Enabled</b> and specify <b>Tilt Range</b> in the Volume Table to use PEET's missing
wedge compensation during alignment and averaging.&nbsp; When selected, object
space averaging of the aligned particles will be replaced by a 
weighted averaging in Fourier space, with each particle 
contributing only to regions in which its projections are informative,
i.e. those lying outside its tomographic missing wedge.&nbsp;
Additionally, during alignment of particles against a 
reference with known missing wedge,
correlations coefficients will be normalized by the fractional overlap
between the informative regions of the particle and the reference.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>Edge shift</b> specifies the number of pixels in from
the edge of the missing wedge to include when averaging with missing
wedge compensation.&nbsp;  Some useful information seems to spread
into the missing wedge during backprojection.&nbsp;  A value of 1
voxel is typical appropriate.</p>

<p>An additional type of missing wedge compensation is available
when using cross-correlation to select particles for averaging at the end 
of each iteration (i.e. when creating a new reference or final averages).&nbsp;  
If the number of <b>Weight groups</b> is set to a number larger than 1,
particles are divided into groups based on their missing wedge orientation.&nbsp;
Correlation scores are then scaled so that each group has approximately the same 
median score.&nbsp; The result is that nearly equal numbers of particles from each 
of the orientation groups will included in the reference (or the final average), 
thus minimizing a missing wedge bias. The appropriate setting must be chosen
heuristically, but depends on the number of available particles as well as the
number of distinct orientations present in the data.&nbsp;  This option is most 
effective if particles assume a variety of original orientations.&nbsp;  
If particles  all have about the same orientation, (e.g. particles from a 
non-twisting microtubule in the X-Y plane), this type of compensation may 
not be necessary or helpful unless Random axial rotations (described below under
<a HREF="#Particle Y Axis Section">2.9. Particle Y Axis Section</a>) 
are used, or a program like modTwist2EM is
used to provide varying starting orientations. Randomized particle
selection, described below under 
<a HREF="#Optional / Advanced Features">3.6. Optional / Advanced Features</a>,
disables this type of missing wedge compensation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Number of Tilt Axes</b> determines how missing tomographic regions are
specified. If <b>1</b> is selected, PEET will automatically generate  
single-tilt-axis missing wedges corresponding to the tilt ranges in
the volume table. If <b>2 or more</b> is selected, PEET will read
binary missing wedge masks from the files whose names are specified under
<b>Missing Wedge Mask</b>. For dual- or multi-tilt axis tomograms, program
multiTiltMask can be used to generate the necessary mask file(s).
</p>

<H4><A NAME="Masking Section"></A>2.8. Masking Section </H4>

<p>Users can specify a mask to limit the portion of the reference
volume to be included in cross-correlation calculations.&nbsp;  
The default, <b>None</b>,is to use the entire volume.&nbsp; 
Spherical, cylindrical, or user-defined masks can be selected by 
checking the appropriate radio button.&nbsp; For both spherical 
and cylindrical masks, both inner and outer radii can be specified, 
allowing definition of either solid regions or hollow shells. Voxels
between the inner and outer radii will be included. 
Truncated cylindrical masks can also be generated using the optional 
Cylinder <b>Height</b> field.

<p>To use an MRC volume containing an arbitrary mask select
the <b>User supplied binary file</b> option, and enter the name of a
file containing the mask volume.&nbsp;  A voxel of the reference volume 
will be masked out (i.e. excluded) if
the value of its corresponding voxel in the mask volume is zero
and included otherwise.&nbsp;
The mask volume size need not match that of the reference.&nbsp;  
If they differ, the mask volume will be centered on the reference, and mask
values outside the reference volume ignored.&nbsp; Mask values outside the
mask volume, but within the reference, will be determined by the value
of the majority of the 8 corner voxels of the mask volume.&nbsp;  
(I.e., if 5 or more corners are zero, the mask will
be zero outside the volume;&nbsp; conversely, if 4 or fewer corners are
zero, the mask will be one outside the mask volume.)&nbsp;
</p>

</p> 
A convenient way to generate a customized mask
volume is to use the IMOD program <a href="man/imodmop.html#TOP">imodmop</a>,
which can be used to generate shapes other than spheres and cylinders. 
By placing closed contours on each section of interest, the region inside
the contour will be included.
For this purpose, it does not matter that this
program leaves original density values rather than 1's in the
region that is retained.&nbsp; (I.e. the user supplied mask is not strictly
required to be binary, although it will be treated as if it were.)</p>

<p>Masks will be centered on the initial reference, and, by default, a cylindrical 
mask will be oriented with its long axis along the reference's Y
axis.&nbsp; You can override the orientation of a
cylindrical mask by selecting <b>Manual Cylinder Orientation</b> and 
specifying the desired Z and Y rotations in degres.</p> 

<p>
By default, masks are treated as binary, leading to an abrupt edge.
To generate a soft-edged mask, enter a positive value for 
<b>Blur mask by</b>, which specifies the standard deviation of a 3D Gaussian 
to be convolved with the original, binary mask before use. The 
resulting soft edge will extend approximately 2.5 standard deviations 
on either side of the original abrupt transition.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="Particle Y Axis Section"></A>2.9. Particle Y Axis Section</H4>

<p>The particle Y axis (or twist axis) is the axis PEET uses for the first
angular search, referred to as Phi in the iteration table.&nbsp;
(Particle X and Z axes are determined from Y to form a right handed coordinate
system, with some arbitrary conventions to resolve ambiguities).&nbsp;
if <b>Tomogram Y axis</b> is selected, the particle Y axis will coincide with
the tomogram Y axis.&nbsp;  In this case, Phi will be around the tomogram Y axis, 
Theta around the tomogram Z axis, and Psi around the tomogram X axis.</p>

<p>If <b>Particle model points</b> is selected, the first rotation
axis will vary from particle to particle and will be the vector
connecting 2 consecutive model points in the IMOD model contour.&nbsp;
With this option, Phi represents twisting around the contour axis;
Theta represents bending or turning in the X-Y plane, and Psi
represents dipping in Z.&nbsp;  This option is most useful when
particles lie along continuous contours, e.g. along a filament such as a
microtubule.&nbsp;  When using this option, be sure to model each
filament in a separate contour.</p>

<p><b>End points of contour</b> is similar to <b>Particle model points</b>,
except that the vector between the first and the last points in the contour
will be taken as the Y axis for each point in that contour.&nbsp; This can 
be useful when the contours are nearly straight, as it provides a less
noisy estimate of the Y axis.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Initial Motive List Section"></A>2.10. Initial Motive List Section</H4>

<P>Controls in this section provide several options for setting up an 
initial motive list with starting orientations for all particles.&nbsp;  
This can allow limiting the angular search range, improving both throughput and 
accuracy, even when the particles have significantly different starting orientations.&nbsp; 

<H5>2.10.1. Set all angles to zero</H5>

<P>All particles will have their initial orientation left unaltered.
This is appropriate if the particles are scattered, independent 
particles, no prior alignment information is available, and the
orientations are either not readily apparent from the images or if
you choose not to extract such information, preferring
instead to rely on a more extensive alignment search.</p>

<H5>2.10.2. Align particle Y axes</H5>

<P>Automatically generate initial motive list rotations to align each particle's Y
axis with that of the reference. This is particularly useful when modeling filaments
and Particle Y axis is set to <b>Particle model points</b> or 
<b>End points of contour</b>.</p>

<H5>2.10.3. User supplied csv files</H5>

<p>Use this option if you have a motive list file in .csv format specifying
the approximate rotation (and, optionally, translation) required to
orient each particle.&nbsp;  Such motive list (MOTL)  files can be
obtained from a prior PEET run or from an auxiliary program
that computes initial orientations from a model for a particular
situation.&nbsp; PEET programs modTwist2EM, spikeInit, and slicer2MOTL are 
examples of such auxilliary programs.&nbsp; Additionally, program modifyMotiveList
can be used to incorporate additional rotations and translations into an existing
motive list, e.g. when imposing symmetry.</p>

<H5>2.10.4. Uniform random rotations</H5>

<P>A random rotation drawn from a uniform distribution will be generated for 
each particle.&nbsp; In conjunction with a limited range angular search, this can be 
useful in avoiding missing wedge bias for isolated particles.&nbsp; With suspected
icosahedral symmetry, for example, a useful approach is to use this option along 
with angular search ranges of roughly +/- 32 degrees.&nbsp; Note that random rotations will
only help avoid missing wedge bias if other knowledge allows using less than a full
spherical search.</p>

<H5>2.10.5. Random axial (Y) rotations</H5>

<P>An initial motive list will be automatically generated which aligns the particles Y
axis to that of the reference, followed by a random rotations around that axis.&nbsp;
This can be helpful in minimizing missing wedge bias, e.g. when averaging sections of a
cylindrcal filament with similar missing wedge orientations and known axial symmetry 
(e.g. a 15 protofilament microtubule).&nbsp; Random axial rotations will help eliminate
missing wedge bias only if other knowledge allows restricting the axial (Phi) search
range.</p> 

<H3><A NAME="The Run Tab"></A>3. The Run Tab</H3>

<H4><A NAME="Parallel Processing"></A>3.1. Parallel Processing</H4>

<p>PEET can distribute the computational load of aligning and averaging
particles over multiple processors on one or more systems, as specified
by the user.&nbsp; This section allows you to select which systems and
how many processors on each system are to be used.&nbsp; See the
<a href="UsingEtomo.html#ParallelProcessing">Using Parallel Processing</a> 
in the eTomo User's Guide for details on these controls and on
configuring parallel processing.  For information on using a cluster queue,
see the IMOD man pages for <a href="man/processchunks.html#TOP">processchunks</a> and
the <a href="man/cpuadoc.html#TOP">cpu.adoc</a> file.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="Iteration Table"></A>3.2. Iteration Table</H4>

<p>Each row of this table controls a single iteration
and has five types of entries.</p>

<p>The <b>Angular Search Range</b> entries set search ranges and
increments (step sizes) in degrees for the 3 rotations (Phi, Theta,
and Psi, referring to rotations around Y, Z, and X axes).&nbsp;  For
example, if <b>Max</b> and <b>Step</b> fields of Phi are set to 6 and
2 respectively, Phi will have a range of -6 to +6 and will assume 7
values (-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, and 6).&nbsp; A general guideline is that 
except for special cases (e.g. a no-search iteration to generate a new
reference) earlier iterations should have larger ranges and step sizes
than later ones.&nbsp; Additionally, multiple iterations with larger step 
sizes are typically faster than a single search with a large range and small
step size.&nbsp; A reasonable compromise is to use a <b>Max</b> of 3 times <b>Step</b>,
as in the example above.&nbsp; Both <b>Max</b> and <b>Step</b> can then be reduced 
by a factor of 2 at each subsequent iteration, until the desired precision is 
achieved.&nbsp; Searches with even fewer steps can be done by using a <b>Max</b> 
of twice the increment, provided that <b>Max</b> and <b>Step</b> are reduced by 
a factor of only 1.5-1.6 between iterations.&nbsp; In many cases, it may be necessary 
to use more steps than this during the first iteration to obtain a reasonable initial 
alignment.&nbsp;  To skip searching around a particular axis entirely, set the 
<b>Max</b> to 0 and <b>Step</b> to 1.</p>

<p><b>Search Distance</b> can be either a single number or
three numbers, and specifies the amount of translation in pixels allowed in the
X, Y, and Z directions during alignment searches.&nbsp;  
For example, setting it to 2 will limit
the translation to between -2 and +2 in each of the 3 directions.&nbsp;
These directions are in tomogram rather than particle coordinates,
so using different limits would be useful only if particles all had similar 
orientations with respect to at least one tomogram axis.&nbsp;  This entry does not typically affect
execution time, but small values can make the alignment more reliable by preventing
spurious correlation peaks at higher translations from being chosen.&nbsp;
A search distance of 0 can be
specified to disable searching, allowing the quality of the initial
alignment to be determined.</p>

<p><b>High Freq. Filter</b> specifies parameters for
filtering out high frequencies (i.e. for a low-pass filter).&nbsp;  
As in IMOD, frequencies are in
reciprocal voxels, with 0.5 being the Nyquist frequency, and 0.86 
corresponding to the highest frequency in the corners of 3D FFTs.&nbsp;  
The <b>Cutoff</b> field sets the cutoff frequency, below which there is
no attenuation, and above which there is progressively more attenuation.
Above the cutoff, the response falls like the right half of a Gaussian 
with standard deviation given by the <b>Sigma</b> field.&nbsp;
Both the reference and the particle are filtered separately, so the
correlation is effectively filtered twice.&nbsp;  
One way to see the effect of a given filter on a particular volume or particle 
is to apply that filter using IMOD program 
<a href="man/mtffilter.html#TOP">mtffilter</a>, e.g., with
the command "mtffilter -3d -low cutoff, sigma input_file output_file".&nbsp;
Alternatively, you can explore the effect on a selected image plane 
interactively by opening the
volume in 3dmod and then choosing <b>Edit-->Image-->Process-->Fourier filter</b> 
from the menu.</p>

<p><b>Reference Threshold</b> controls how many particles
are used to form the reference for the next iteration.&nbsp;  If a
value larger than one is specified, it represents the number of particles to
use, with higher correlation coefficients chosen preferentially
(unless <b>Randomized particle selection</b> is specified under
<a HREF="#Optional / Advanced Features">3.6. Optional / Advanced Features</a>).&nbsp;  
A rule of thumb is to use
two thirds of the total number of particles.&nbsp; In some cases, however,
you might want to include all particles, especially if limited data are available
or at the first iteration to minimize
any missing wedge bias in the new reference.&nbsp;  If a value less than one
is specified, it represents a correlation coefficient threshold, above which
particles will be included in computation of the new reference.&nbsp;  
We have not found specifying the threshold in this latter manner
particularly useful.</p>

<p><b>Duplicate Tolerance</b> provides control over PEET's 
duplicate rejection logic.&nbsp; When the search range is comparable to
the spacing between particles, and 
especially when particles lie along filaments, 
an alignment search can sometimes result in mulitple particles pointing
to essentially the same position and orientation.&nbsp; 
If not corrected, these errors can bias subsequent 
references and averages, and can lead to overestimation of 
resolution using Fourier Shell Correlation.&nbsp; If
<b>Remove duplicate particles after each iteration</b>
is checked (below the Iteration Table), PEET will
attempt to identify cases of duplication, and will remove 
offending particles from further averaging or consideration during
the current iteration.&nbsp; The <b>Shift</b> and <b>Angular</b> 
tolerances specify
the maximum separation in integer pixels and degrees, respectively, at 
at which particles can be considered duplicates.&nbsp; 
Two particles are considered duplicates only if their separation 
exceeds neither of these tolerances. 
The shift tolerance is applied separately to
each of the tomogram X, Y, and Z coordinates. Duplication is determined
independently near the end of each iteration, so a particle ignored as
a duplicate in one iteration is not necessarily 
excluded from later iterations.&nbsp;
A value of 0 for either or both of the angular and shift tolerances 
can be used to disable duplicate removal for the associated iteration.

<p>As for the Volume Table, action buttons to the right of the 
Iteration Table allow adding, deleting, or rearranging lines in the table.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Spherical Sampling for Theta and Psi Section"></A>3.3.Spherical Sampling for Theta and Psi Section</H4>

<p>This option is designed to make full angular searching at the
first iteration more efficient by sampling orientation space at
relatively uniform intervals.&nbsp;  This is referred to as spherical
sampling because the second and third search angles (Theta and Psi)
are chosen to given approximately uniform spacing when represented on
the surface of a sphere.&nbsp;  (Phi corresponds to rotation around
the particle's twist or Y axis).&nbsp;  Simply
varying both Theta and Psi with regular increments results in oversampling
near the poles.&nbsp;  With spherical sampling enabled, PEET 
avoids this oversampling.&nbsp;  If <b>Full sphere</b> is checked,
PEET will sample the whole sphere.&nbsp;  If <b>Half sphere</b> is
checked, PEET will only sample one hemisphere.&nbsp;  The
<b>Sample interval</b> field specifies the Theta search interval in
degrees, as well as the Psi search interval at the equator.&nbsp;
For a unit sample sphere, sample points are placed on latitude lines 
separated by the sample interval, with approximately 360 / Sample interval 
points along along each latitude line at the equator, decreasing with
latitude to no more than a single point at each pole.&nbsp; For either
a full or half sphere angular search, enter a <b>Max</b> of 180, with
an appropriate <b>Step</b> for Phi in the Iteration Table, as well as the
<b>Sample interval</b> for spherical samping.&nbsp; It is typically 
reasonable to choose the <b>Sample interval</b> equal to the Phi Step size.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Number of Particles to Average"></A>3.4. Number of Particles to Average</H4>

<p>Specify how many particles to use to form averages.&nbsp;  For
example, if <b>Start</b>, <b>Step</b>, <b>End</b>, and <b>Additional numbers</b>
are set to to  50, 50, 200, and 205, respectively,  there
will be 5 final averages, containing 50, 100, 150, 200 and 205 particles.&nbsp;
Values listed under 
<b>Additional numbers</b> must be comma separated, monotonically increasing,
and greater than the <b>End</b> value of the arithmetic sequence.&nbsp;
The largest average requested should be no greater than the total number of particles
available.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Use Equal Numbers of Particles from All Tomograms"></A>3.5. Use Equal Numbers of Particles from All Tomograms</H4>

<p>These checkboxes provide another tool for reducing bias when combining data from multiple 
tomograms.&nbsp;  If checked, PEET will attempt to use equal numbers of particles
from each tomogram when computing averages or new references.&nbsp; (Unequal numbers may still 
be used if required to  achieve the requested number of particles).&nbsp;
If left unchecked, it will choose particles without regard to 
which tomogram(s) they are in.</p>

<H4><A NAME="Optional / Advanced Features"></A>3.6. Optional / Advanced Features</H4>

<p> This section contains a number of useful, but less often used controls.</p>

<p>If <b>Align averages to have their Y axes vertical</b> is selected, average volumes will be 
reoriented to have their Y axis approximately vertical.&nbsp; This is particularly useful for
particles along a straight or slightly curved filament.&nbsp; Note that the
reorientation is applied only to the particles as they are averaged and will not be
reflected in the final motive list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>if <b>Use absolute value of cross-correlation</b>  is checked, PEET will maximize 
the absolute value of the cross-correlation, rather than its signed value, during
alignment searches.&nbsp; This can help prevent noise from reinforcing to match features
in the reference.&nbsp; This works well for many biological structures which are globular
or irregularly shaped.&nbsp; Use it with caution, however, with repeating or highly
symmetric structures where there is a chance of aligning "out of phase" (i.e. dark
on light).</p>

<p>If <b>Save individual aligned particles</b> is checked, each individual subvolume
contributing to one of the final averages will be saved to an MRC file named
aligned*.mrc.&nbsp; Use this option judiciously, as it can consume large amounts of 
disk space.</p>

<p>Normally PEET treats the Angular Search Ranges and Search Distance from each iteration
as completely separate from those at any other iteration.  So, for example, if Search Distances
of 5, 4, and 3 voxels were specified at each of 3 iterations, it is possible that a particle
could be translated by up to 5+4+3 = 12 voxels in each of the X, Y, and Z directions.&nbsp;
If <b>Strict search limit checking</b> is checked, the maximum shift from the starting
position in each direction is limited to the largest distance specified at any iteration... 
in this case 5 voxels.&nbsp; (Maximum Angular Search Ranges are treated similarly). This 
can be useful when refining an initial alignment, since the optimum at each iteration is
expected to be within the search range of the previous ones.
</p>

<p><b>No reference refinement</b> allows for alignment against a fixed reference 
(i.e. template matching).&nbsp; Normally, PEET generates a new reference at the end of
each iteration based on the current alignment.&nbsp; If <b>no reference refinement</b>
is checked, the initial reference (whether user supplied our automatically generated),
will be used for all alignment iterations without modification.</p>

<p>
<b>Randomized particle selection</b> indicates that particles should be
selected for inclusion in averages or new references at random, rather
than based on their cross-correlation scores. In some cases, this can
minimize reinforcement of noise to match a biased initial reference
selection. Randomized particle selection is incompatible with
<a HREF="#Missing Wedge Compensation Section">Missing Wedge Compensation</a> 
during alignment, however, and will effectively set the number of 
<b>Weight Groups</b> to 1.
</p>

<p><b>Particles per CPU</b> controls the splitting of alignment searches into "chunks"
for parallel execution on multiple CPUS.&nbsp; No more than the specified number of particles 
will be sent simultaneously to a single CPU for alignment.&nbsp;
The smaller this value, the more command and log files will be created, and, within limits,
the greater the overall throughput.&nbsp; Too high a value, can lead to long 
delays should you wish to pause and then resume the processing.&nbsp; 
The default of 5 is a good choice for most purposes; if eTomo reports more than a few thousand 
chunks to be processed, you may wish to consider raising this setting.</p>

<p><b>Debug level</b> (0, 1, 2, or 3) controls the amount of information included in the log 
files, with higher numbers leading to more verbose logs.</p>

<p>PEET can suppress low frequencies from both particles and the reference
(i.e. apply a high-pass filter).&nbsp; 
<b>Low frequency cutoff</b> is the frequency in inverse pixels
 below  which the signal will be attenuated.&nbsp; As in the iteration table, <b>Sigma</b>
is the standard deviation of the Gaussian whose left half defines the shape of the
resulting high-pass filter.&nbsp; We have rarely found low frequency filtering to
be useful, and do not recommend its routine use.</p>

<p><b>Average only members of classes</b> can be used to  create averages 
containing only selected subsets of the particles.&nbsp; This is most often 
useful after classification with programs pca and clusterPca, but can be 
used following any other operation which places the desired numeric class 
labels in column 20 of the motive list.&nbsp; Multiple classes can be 
specified separated by commas, with ranges indicated with ":".</p>

<H4><A NAME="3.7 Action Buttons"></A>3.7. Action Buttons</H4>

<p>After reviewing and selecting Systems and / or processors in the
Processing Table, press <b>Run</b> to start processing.&nbsp;
At this point, eTomo will write the parameter file and run the PEET 
program prmParser, producing a series of command (.com) files which
will be executed by processchunks to carry out the requested computations.&nbsp; 
During processing, status will be indicated by progress bar at the top of the page.
Additional status information may be obtained from the messages in the optionally visible log window,
as well as from the Parallel processing section.&nbsp; Note that once a run has been started
it is permissible to close the eTomo gui if desired;&nbsp; if the same project is later
opened in a new eTomo window <i>on the same system from which it was originally run</i>, 
it will reconnect to any processes still running and 
update the status accordingly.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>When processing is complete, press <b>Open Averaged Volumes in
3dmod</b> to view the computed averages in 3dmod.&nbsp;
The Zap and Isosurface windows will be opened automatically.&nbsp;  Note that
the isosurface threshold can be adjusted independently for each average.&nbsp;  
Similarly, pressing <b>Open Reference Files in 3dmod</b> will allow you to view 
the references generated at each iteration.&nbsp;  You can also select
<b>Remake Averaged Volumes</b> to recompute averages using the existing
alignment, e.g. after changing the number of particles to average or
other settings.</p> 

<H4><A NAME="Resampling Existing Volumes / Models"></A>3.8 Resampling
  Existing Volumes / Models</H4>

<p>In some cases it may be desirable to change the origin, image size,
or voxel size of an existing IMOD volume and its corresponding
model for use with PEET.&nbsp; For example, one may wish to create a
binned version to reduce memory requirements or to speed preliminary
characterization.&nbsp; This is easy using IMOD, but must be done in a 
specific way to preserve compatability with both PEET and 
<a href="man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</a>.</p> 

<p>First, it is necessary to ensure the starting model contains
information about the associated volume.&nbsp; To do this, simply open the
volume and the model together in <a href="man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</a>, 
and then re-save the model;&nbsp; equivalently, use 
"<a href="man/imodtrans.html#TOP">imodtrans</a> -i" to update the existing 
model, as illustrated below.&nbsp; Second, create the modified volume
using one or more IMOD tools such as 
"<a href="man/binvol.html#TOP">binvol</a>" or 
"<a href="man/clip.html#TOP">clip</a> -resize".&nbsp; Finally, generate
the revised model either by a) opening the modified volume and the 
original model together in <a href="man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</a>, or 
b) by using "<a href="man/imodtrans.html#TOP">imodtrans</a> -i".</p>

<p>
For example, to perform 2-fold binning on a dataset in which the
original volume and model were named "old.rec" and "old.mod", 
respectively, one might use<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
imodtrans -i old.rec old.mod old.mod<BR>
binvol -b 2 old.rec new.rec<BR>
imodtrans -i new.rec old.mod new.mod<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In this case, the first operation could also have been done by
running "3dmod old.rec old.mod" and then selecting the "File / Save" menu
entry.&nbsp; Similarly, the final operation could have been done by running
"3dmod new.rec old.mod", selecting "File / Save As", and specifying 
"new.mod" as the name for the new model.</p>
<p>

If the voxel size has been changed, parameter file settings (e.g. mask
radii) must be modified accordingly.&nbsp; Similarly, offsets which are 
stored in columns 11-13 of the motive list will need to be scaled
manually; motive lists are stored in comma-separated-value (csv) 
format, so a spreadsheet program can be used to make any changes required.
