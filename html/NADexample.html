          This tutorial will guide you through filtering a cryo data set with Nonlinear
            Anisotropic Diffusion (NAD).
    Filtering with NAD is relatively slow and involves adjusting two parameters to 
    give the desired amount of filtering.&nbsp; The strategy is to do the operation 
    on a small test volume and compare the results from different parameter settings 
    in order to pick the right setting.&nbsp; After that, the full volume is 
    filtered by breaking it into chunks so that multiple processors can be used.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style1">
        &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1">
        Filtering is done with the program nad_eed_3d, contributed to IMOD by Frangakis 
        and Hegerl.&nbsp; The <a href="man/nad_eed_3d.html#TOP">man page</a> for that program has a bit more information and a 
        reference to their paper.</p>

          Getting started:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This example uses the &quot;cryo&quot; reconstruction produced in our &nbsp;<a 
              href="cryoExample.html#TOP">basic cryo tutorial</a>.&nbsp; If you have done 
            that tutorial, cd to the directory where that reconstruction is located and skip 
            to the last step in this section.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/files/cryoSubset.tar.bz">
            download</a> the trimmed reconstruction from our web site.</li>
          <li>Move the data set file &quot;cryoSubset.tar.bz&quot; to the directory where you want to 
            work on it.&nbsp; Its contents will unpack a file &quot;cryoSubset.rec&quot; into a 
            subdirectory named &quot;cryo&quot;.</li>
          <li>cd to the directory with the file &quot;cryoSubset.tar.bz&quot;</li>
          <li>Enter the command:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imoduntar cryoSubset.tar.bz<br />
            or, anywhere except on Windows without Cygwin, you can use<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjf cryoSubset.tar.bz</li>
          <li>Enter the dataset directory with:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cryo</li>
          <li>Start eTomo by entering
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etomo<br />
            and press <b>Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion</font></b></li>
        </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Extracting the Test Volume:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press the file chooser icon on the <b>Pick a volume</b> line and select 
    <i>cryo.rec</i> (if you did the &quot;cryo&quot; tutorial) or <i>cryoSubset.rec</i> (if 
    you downloaded this file).</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>View Full Volume</b>. </li>
  <li>
    Zoom the Zap window up to 1 if necessary, and draw a rubber band in the middle 
    that is about 300x300 pixels (see the size in the Zap toolbar).</li>
  <li>
    Scroll through the slices and set the Lo and Hi limits to extract 25-30 slices.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Get Test Volume Range from 3dmod</b> to fetch the range into eTomo.</li>
  <li>
    Press Extract Test Volume.</li>
    <li>Press <b>View Test Volume </b>to make sure you got the selected area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Finding K Value for the Test Volume:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    For <b>List of K values</b>, enter <i>0.1,1,5,10,15,25,30,50,75</i></li>
  <li>
    Keep the <b>Iterations</b> at <i>10</i>.</li>
  <li>
    Select some CPUs 
    (up to 9 if possible) and press <b>Run with Different K Values</b>.&nbsp; It computes 
    a volume for each K value, using multiple processors.&nbsp; The K value controls 
    how the diffusion of density occurs on each iteration.&nbsp; Where the image 
    gradient is higher than K, this is considered to represent an edge, and density 
    flows along the edge and not across it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the image gradient is 
    lower than K, density diffuses uniformly.</li>
  <li>
    When done, press <b>View Different K Values Test Results</b> to load the 
    multiple volumes into 3dmod.&nbsp; The Zap window has a second toolbar with <b>
    4th D</b> left and right arrows for stepping between the volumes (the keys 1 and 
    2 can also be used).&nbsp; The toolbar also shows the name of the file being 
    displayed.</li>
    <li>
      One way to compare the volumes is to step between them in one window; this is 
      the best way to see how they change from one to the next.</li>
    <li>
      To see the volumes side-by-side, select <b>Linked Slicers</b> from the <b>Image</b> 
      menu.&nbsp; A slicer will open for each volume, each one locked to that volume 
      (note the red lock icon in the toolbar).&nbsp; The slicers will be kept at the 
      same orientation and position, controlled by a single floating toolbar.</li>
    <li>
      Images look strange for intermediate K values (10 - 25), with regions of uniform 
      intensity.&nbsp; Above this range, K is too high to stop the diffusion across 
      places of high gradient, and diffusion is essentially isotropic.&nbsp; Within 
      this range, diffusion is blocked across medium to high gradients, so the density 
      probably gets trapped in medium-sized regions bounded by these gradients and 
      becomes evenly distributed.&nbsp; Below this K range, there are many, more 
      closely-spaced, gradients to block diffusion, and this probably prevents the 
      noticeable uniform regions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Finding Iteration Number for the Test Volume:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Pick your preferred K value and enter it in the <b>K value</b> field.</li>
  <li>
    For <b>List of iterations</b>, enter <i>2,5,8,11,15,21</i>.</li>
    <li>
      Press <b>Run with Different Iterations</b>.&nbsp; This time the nad_eed_3d 
      program runs once, saving the results at each selected iteration.</li>
    <li>
      Press <b>View Different Iteration Test Results</b>.&nbsp; This time it is 
      probably easier to assess the preferred filtering by stepping through the 
      volumes in the Zap window.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Filtering the Full Volume:</u></p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Insert your selected K value in the <b>K value</b> field and number of 
    iterations in the <b>Iterations</b> field.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>
      Select as many CPUs as possible and press <b>Filter Full Volume</b>.</li>
    <li>
      When it is done, you can open it with <b>View Filtered Volume</b>, and delete 
      the test volumes with <b>Clean Up Subdirectory</b>.&nbsp; The final volume is 
      named by adding the extension &quot;.nad&quot; to the name of the original volume.&nbsp; 
      Note that the extensions &quot;.rec&quot; and &quot;.nad&quot; are simply conventions and do not 
      specify a file format; this volume is an MRC file.</li>
