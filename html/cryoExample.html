        This is a guided introduction to generating a tomogram from a tilt series 
        of a cryo-sample with gold beads as fiducial markers for alignment.&nbsp; It 
        presents the most important concepts and details and provides brief explanations 
        of some points.&nbsp; For more details, consult the <a href="guide.html#TOP">Tomography Guide</a>, which you 
        can open from the Help menu in eTomo.&nbsp; It is also advisable to read through 
        relevant sections of the <a href="guide.html#TOP">Tomography Guide</a> before trying to process your own tilt 
        series.&nbsp; If you have processed a tilt series in eTomo before, you may want 
        to do the <a href="etomoTutorial.html#TOP">dual-axis tutorial</a> before this 
        example, especially if you have difficulty following the steps below without 
        shots of how the screen should appear.</o:p></p>

        <o:p>First, a few points on conventions: labels in the eTomo or 3dmod interface are shown 
        in <b>Bold</b>, and entries in fields are shown in <i>italics</i>.&nbsp; For 
        mouse operations in the Zap window in 3dmod, the buttons are referred to as 
        &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;third&quot; because the buttons can be remapped in 3dmod.&nbsp; 
        If you have not changed the mapping, this corresponds to left, middle, and 
        right; otherwise, it refers to whatever you have chosen to be the first, second, 
        and third buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </o:p>

    Getting started:</p>
      <ul>
        <LI><a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/files/cryoExampleData.tar.bz">
      Download</a> the sample data set from our web site.</li>
        <LI>Move the data set file &quot;cryoExampleData.tar.bz&quot; to the directory where you want to 
        work on it.&nbsp; Its contents will unpack into a subdirectory named &quot;cryo&quot;.</li>
        <LI>cd to the directory with the file</li>
        <LI>Enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imoduntar cryoExampleData.tar.bz<br />
          or, anywhere except on Windows without Cygwin, you can use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjf cryoExampleData.tar.bz</li>
        <LI>Enter the dataset directory with:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cryo</li>
        <LI>Now you need to redefine the environment variable IMOD_CALIB_DIR to be the 
          current directory, which is simply &quot;.&quot; (a period or dot), so that eTomo can find 
          some microscope-specific files used in the processing.&nbsp;Thus, you need to 
          enter a period at the end of all the command below to represent 
          the current directory.
          <ul> <li>On Linux, Mac OS X, 
          or Windows with Cygwin, first give this command so that you will still have access 
            to parallel processing resources:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; cp $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/cpu.adoc .</LI>
          
          </ul>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>On Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows with Cygwin, if you are using the bash shell or a related shell, 
          enter:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export IMOD_CALIB_DIR=.<br />Or, if you are use tcsh as the shell, enter:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv IMOD_CALIB_DIR .<br />
          </LI>
          <li>On Windows without Cygwin, enter:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set IMOD_CALIB_DIR=.<br />
          </li>
        </ul>

    <u>Tomogram setup:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        In this initial step, we define some features of the data set and create the 
        files needed for processing.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press <b>Build Tomogram</b> in the eTomo "Front Page"</li>
  <li>
    Press the yellow file chooser icon on the <b>Datatset name</b> line and select the stack file.</li>
  <li>
    For <b>SystemTemplate</b>, select
    <i>cryoSample.adoc</i>.  This will set several parameters appropriately for cryo 
    reconstructions; you should generally select a template.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Scan Header</b> to retrieve the pixel size and rotation angle of 
    the tilt axis from the image file.</li>
  <li>
    Enter “15” for <b>Fiducial diameter</b></li>
    <li>
      Select <b>Parallel Processing</b> if you have more than one CPU core.</li>
  <li>
    Select <b>Graphics card processing</b> if you have an Nvidia card with a GPU that can be used with IMOD.</li>
  <li>
    For <b>Image distortion field file</b>, 
    select <i>27.5kGIF2007-03-24.idf</i>.  Data were taken with an energy filter which introduces significant geometric distortions. 
    The distortions were measured and can be corrected with this file.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>View Raw Stack</b> and scroll 
    through the images to see that they are not well-aligned.
    &nbsp; Notice the 4 contrast control sliders, which are present because the 
    data have been loaded as integers.&nbsp; 
    The top two sliders are very close together, which means the image data occupy a 
    very small fraction of the full data range; the rest of the data range is taken 
    up by image artifacts due to X-rays.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Create Com Scripts</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Pre-processing:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        This step is needed to remove artifacts in the images, generally produced by 
        X-ray events in the camera.&nbsp; These artifacts will produce streaks in a 
        reconstruction and can also make it harder to see the image features, which have 
        a much smaller dynamic range than the artifacts.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press <b>Show Min/Max for Raw Stack</b> to 
    see the range of the data; both a plot of minimum and maximum values and a table 
    with more detailed information will open.&nbsp; Every view has a large negative minimum because there 
    was an X-ray artifact in the dark reference.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Create Fixed Stack</b> to run the program that finds and erases 
    artifacts.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>View Fixed Stack</b>.&nbsp; Now there are only 2 contrast sliders because data 
    can be loaded as bytes after removing most of the artifacts.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Show Min/Max for Fixed Stack</b> to 
    see the new range of data.&nbsp; 
    Deviations of 50-100 from the rest of the data will not matter in the 
    reconstruction.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Use Fixed Stack</b>.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Done</b> to advance to the next step.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Coarse Alignment</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        In this step, we use image cross-correlation to align successive images, which 
        makes it easier to track fiducial markers.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Press <b>Calculate Cross-Correlation</b></li>
  <li>
    When done, press <b>Generate Coarse Aligned Stack</b></li>
  <li>
    When done, press <b>View Aligned Stack in 
    3dmod</b>.&nbsp; Scroll through the images 
    to see that they now look aligned</li>
    <li>
      Press <b>Done</b> to go on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">
    <u>Fiducial Model Generation:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        In this step, the positions of selected gold markers are found on all of the 
        images, which allows a more accurate alignment to be obtained.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Use <b>Make seed and track</b> and
    <b>Make seed model manually</b> options.&nbsp; The option to make the seed model 
    automatically works quite well; we are not using it so that you learn how to do 
    this step manually if necessary.</li>
  <li>
    Press <b>Seed Fiducial Model</b>. The Bead Fixer window opens in <b>Make seed</b> 
    mode with most of the settings that you need for adding seed points.</li>
      <li>
        Turn on <b>Automatic new contour</b> in the Bead Fixer window if it is not on already.&nbsp; A contour is 
        a set of connected points.&nbsp; We need to put these points in separate 
        contours because a) we don't want to see them connected and b) each contour will 
        be added to with the corresponding points on other views.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>
        Place the cursor very near each bead and add a point with the second mouse 
        button.&nbsp; It will be automatically centered (the <b>Autocenter</b> option is 
        turned on by eTomo in seeding mode).</li>
      <li>
        Press the S key to save the model.</li>
      <li>
        Switch to the <b>Track Beads</b> tab and press <b>Track Seed Model</b>.</li>
      <li>
        The Project Log window shows the number of missing points when done.&nbsp; It 
        may be 0.</li>
      <li>
        Press Fix Fiducial Model, which will load the tracked model into 3dmod and 
        switch the Bead Fixer to <b>Fill gaps</b> mode.&nbsp; You can scroll through the 
        views and also press the V key to see the tracks of the beads in 3D.</li>
      <li>
        If there are missing points, you can now use the Bead Fixer to step from one gap 
        to the next (using the space bar as a hot key) and add a point, if appropriate.&nbsp; <i>A bead does not need to be 
        marked on every view, and you should not add a point if the bead's position is 
        not clear</i>.&nbsp; If you add points, be sure to save the model with the S 
        key.</li>
      <li>
        Another way to complete the model is to press <b>Track with Fiducial Model as 
        Seed</b>.&nbsp; It is a good idea to look at the model in 3D first and make sure 
        there are not deviant points at the ends of contours that should be
        fixed first.</li>
    <li>
        Press <b>Done</b> to go on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style1">
        <u>Fine Alignment:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        Next the bead positions are fit to a mathematical model of specimen movements.&nbsp; 
        The model predicts a position for each bead on each view, and the mean distance 
        between the predicted and actual positions is referred to as the &quot;mean residual 
        error&quot;.&nbsp; These errors will let you find and correct badly modeled points.&nbsp; 
        The need to do so has been much reduced by the recent addition of a method 
        called &quot;robust fitting&quot;, which automatically gives less weight or even 
        eliminates the points most likely to be at incorrect positions.&nbsp; However, 
        it is good to learn how positions can be fixed manually.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Select <b>Do not sort fiducials into 2 surfaces for analysis</b></li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Compute Alignment</b>.&nbsp; When it is done, the Mean residual error 
        will appear in the Project Log.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>View 3D Model</b> to open the model of solved positions in 3D and 
        assess whether to solve for distortion (stretching and skew).&nbsp; Press the R 
        key in the Model View window for a side-view of the model.&nbsp; If you press the 
        middle mouse button and move the mouse to the right, the model will rotate until 
        the three lower beads are very close together.</li>
      <li>
        To solve for distortion, fiducials should be well-distributed in Z: not all on 
        one plane, more than a few at a different Z height, and the ones at a different 
        height distributed over the area.&nbsp; This is not often the case for cryo data 
        sets, and this one fails the latter two tests.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>View/Edit Fiducial Model.</b> The Bead Fixer will open in (or 
        be switched to) <b>Fix big 
        residuals</b> 
        mode and read in the log from alignment.&nbsp; Zoom up in the Zap window to 2 or 
        so.&nbsp; It is also helpful to switch the Zap window to keeping the current 
        model point centered, by pressing the concentric squares in the toolbar.</li>
      <li>
        If you press <b>Go to Next Big Residual</b> or the single quote (') key, it will 
        move to each point with a big residual in order by decreasing value.&nbsp; If a 
        point is not centered on the gold bead, you can move it to the correct position 
        by clicking with the third mouse button.&nbsp; The red arrow points to the 
        position predicted by the alignment solution; it is not based on any knowledge 
        of what is in the image.&nbsp; <i>This position may not be 
        correct</i>, but if it is, you can move the point to that position with <b>
        Move Point by Residual</b> or the semicolon (;) key.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>
        All of the biggest residuals occur at very high tilt, and each point has been 
        correctly modeled, so there is nothing to fix.&nbsp; The reason for this is 
        evident if you examine the output from the alignment program.</li>
      <li>
        Right-click in eTomo over the <b>Fine Alignment</b> panel and select <b>Align 
        log file</b>.&nbsp; The error summary and the ratio of measured values to 
        variables solved for are in the <b>Errors</b> tab.&nbsp; Switch to the <b>
        Solution</b> tab to see the alignment parameters.</li>
      <li>
        Various columns from the solution table can be plotted by right-clicking in 
        eTomo and selecting a particular parameter.&nbsp; Right-click and select <b>Plot 
        global mean residual</b>.&nbsp; Notice that the mean residual gets much higher 
        at high tilt, which is why we saw only those points having the biggest 
        residuals.</li>
      <li>
        To find possible erroneous points at lower tilts in this case, under <b>Residual 
        Reporting</b>, select <b>Relative to Neighboring views</b>.&nbsp; 
        Press <b>Compute Alignment</b> again.</li>
      <li>
        There are no new points to fix.</li>
        <li>
          Press <b>Done</b> to go on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style1">
        <u>Tomogram Positioning</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        The goal of this step is to set angles and an offset in Z so that the specimen 
        is flat and centered in Z in the computed volume, thus minimizing the 
        computational effort.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Set <b>Sample tomogram thickness</b> to <i>500</i>.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Create Whole Tomogram</b> to build a whole, binned-down tomogram.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Create Boundary Model</b> to open the tomogram</li>
      <li>
        Open a Slicer window with <b>Image-Slicer</b>.&nbsp; Set X-rotation to <i>90</i> 
        and <b>Thick: Img</b> to <i>20,</i> which makes it average 20 slices.</li>
      <li>
        The goal is to draw a pair of lines enclosing the sample at ~3 different Y 
        locations in the tomogram. For this specimen we can see the boundaries of the 
        sample well in cross-section, so this is the easiest way to draw them.</li>
      <li>
        Use the <b>View axis position</b> slider to scroll through Y and get a sense of 
        how the boundaries change.</li>
      <li>
        Go to the middle (~340) and draw two lines.&nbsp; 3dmod will automatically start 
        a new contour after two points.&nbsp; Move the current point with the third 
        mouse button; use the first mouse button to select a new current point. See the 
        image below.</li>
      <li>
        Do the same near the lower end of the tomogram (axis position ~70) and the upper 
        end (~610).&nbsp; Your final model should 6 contours with 2 points each.</li>
      <li>
        Save the model with the S key.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Compute Z Shift &amp; Pitch Angles</b>.&nbsp; The angle offset, Z shift, X-axis 
        tilt and tomogram thickness are shown; these will give the thinnest, most level 
        tomogram containing the area you outlined.&nbsp; The required thickness is also

        <u>Gold Erasing:</u> </p>
      <p class="style1">
        Gold beads are by far the densest items in cryo-reconstructions and they 
        cast artifactual rays that are about as dense as the biological features.&nbsp; 
        To minimize this effect, it is often desirable to remove the beads from the

        Press the V key to open the Model View.&nbsp; If you see only 10 of the 11 model 
        points (because of a bug in Findbeads3d) push the <b>Threshold</b> slider to the 
        left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the mouse near one of them and click the right button; the 
        Zap window will change to show that model point on the image.&nbsp; If 
        necessary, you could add or delete points in this model.&nbsp; Close 3dmod.</li>
      <li>
        Press <b>Reproject Model</b> then <b>View 2D Model on Aligned Stack</b>.&nbsp; 
        Look at the high tilt views; you will see that some of the points are not 
        well-centered.</li>
      <li>
        Change two parameters to compensate for this poor centering: set <b>Diameter to

        <u>Automatic Seed Model Generation:</u></p>
      <p class="style1">
        Making the seed model manually was just an training exercise; you should be able 
        to make this model automatically with almost all of your own data sets.&nbsp; 
        For an example of doing this, return to the <b>Fiducial Model Generation</b> 
        page.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
            You may first wish to save the files from your manual work (cryo.seed and 
            cryo.fid) by copying them to a different name.
        </li>
        <li>
            Switch to the <b>Seed Model</b> tab and select <b>Generate Seed Model</b> 
            automatically.

        <li>
            The one required entry is either a number or density of beads to select.&nbsp; 
            Enter <i>25</i> for <b>Total number</b>.&nbsp; You can enter a standard number 
            appropriate for the size of the images, even there are not nearly that many 
            beads.&nbsp; It will find as many as it can, but not select more than the 
            indicated number.
        </li>
        <li>
            The option to <b>Use boundary model</b> is available in cases where you do not 
            want fiducials outside of a defined area.&nbsp; In cryoET, it is usually 
            desirable to avoid using beads over the carbon, if possible.

            When it is done, the project log shows the essential results: there were 10 
            candidate beads, 1 was considered too elongated to use, and it thus picked 9.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <b>Open Seed Model</b> to see the points picked.&nbsp; You will have to 
            page up one view to see them.&nbsp; One bead was eliminated from consideration 
            because it was too near the left edge.&nbsp; The other bead skipped is in the 
            upper left quadrant.&nbsp; It looks fine at zero degrees but is actually two 
            beads on top of each other and tracks poorly at higher tilts.&nbsp; The program 
            eliminated it because it detected sufficient elongation in the lower tilts that 
            it examined.

        series stack can also &quot;archived&quot; by compressing its difference from the current 
        stack; this operation is reversible.</p>
        <ul>

            cryo.preali (coarse aligned stack), cryo.ali (final aligned stack), or 
            cryo_full.rec (raw reconstruction, which could be trimmed differently).</li>
