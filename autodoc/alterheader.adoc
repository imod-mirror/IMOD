[Field = Origin]
short = org
type = FT
usage = Change the origin in X, Y, Z
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive ORG)  Change the origin in X, Y, Z.  In IMOD, the
origin is defined as the coordinates of the origin relative to the lower-left
corner of the first section in the file, in units scaled by the pixel size.
The origin is defined in the opposite way in UCSF Chimera; use
INVERTORG/-invertorg to switch the sign of the origin values.

[Field = CellSize]
short = cel
type = FT
usage = Change the cell size in X, Y, Z
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive CEL)  Change the cell size in X, Y, Z.  This will show
up as a change in pixel spacing, as described above.

[Field = PixelSize]
short = del
type = FT
usage = Change the pixel size in X, Y, Z to given values
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive DEL)  Change the pixel size in X, Y, Z to given
values.  The program will change the cell size so that the ratio of cell to
sample size will give the entered pixel size.

[Field = MapIndexes]
short = map
type = IT
usage = Set mapping from X, Y, Z to rows, columns, sections
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive MAP)  Set mapping from X, Y, Z to rows, columns,
sections.  The only effect of this in IMOD is to reorder the sample grid and
pixel spacing values by the given mapping.  Do not use it.

[Field = SampleSize]
short = sam
type = IT
usage = Set sampling in X, Y, Z
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive SAM)  Set sampling in X, Y, Z.  See note above on IMOD
conventions. 

[Field = TiltCurrent]
short = tlt
type = FT
usage = Change current tilt angles to given alpha, beta, gamma
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive TLT)  Change current tilt angles to given alpha, beta,
gamma.  These values will be used to apply a rotation to a model loaded into
3dmod along with the image.

[Field = TiltOriginal]
short = firsttlt
type = FT
usage = Change original tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive TLT_ORIG)  Change original tilt angles.  These angles
have no effect in IMOD.

[Field = RotateTilt]
short = rottlt
type = FT
usage = Rotate current tilt angles by the given alpha, beta, and gamma.
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive TLT_ROT)  Rotate current tilt angles by the given
alpha, beta, and gamma values, where the rotations are applied the order gamma
(around Z), beta (around Y), alpha (around X).

[Field = MinMaxMean]
short = mmm
type = B
usage = Recompute the minimum, maximum, and mean and the RMS density
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive MMM)  Read the file to recompute the minimum, maximum, and mean
densities and the RMS density.

[Field = RootMeanSquare]
short = rms
type = B
usage = Print current RMS value then do same operation as -mmm
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive RMS)  Print the current RMS value (root-mean-square
deviation from the mean density) then do the same operation as MMM/-mmm.

[Field = FixPixel]
short = fixpixel
type = B
usage = Set the cell and sample sizes the same as the image size
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive FIXPIXEL)  Set the cell and sample sizes the same as
the image size, resulting in a pixel spacing of 1, 1, 1.

[Field = FeiPixel]
short = feipixel
type = I
usage = Set the pixel spacing in X, Y, Z from the extended header
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive FEIPIXEL)  Set the pixel spacing in X, Y, Z from the
value for the pixel size of the first section in an Agard/FEI-style extended
header.  If the existing pixel spacing is not 1 but is equal to 2, 3, or 4,
this will be assumed to represent a binning of the data, and the pixel size
will be multiplied by this value.  However, if the pixel size has already been
transferred or the pixel spacing does not correspond to a small integer, the
program will transfer the pixel size only if a positive number is entered for
this option.  It will exit if 0 or a negative nunber is entered for this
option when running with command-line arguments, or if -1 is entered when
running interactively.

[Field = FixExtra]
short = extrafix
type = B
usage = Change header flags to avoid misinterpreting as a montage
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive FIXEXTRA)  Change the flags in the header so that 3dmod no longer
interprets the extended header as having piece coordinates for a montage.

[Field = FixMode]
short = modefix
type = B
usage = Change mode from 1 (signed 16-bit integer) to 6 (unsigned) or
from 6 to 1
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive FIXMODE)  Change mode from 1 (signed 16-bit integer)
to 6 (unsigned) or from 6 to 1.  The program will warn if the current minimum
and maximum densities indicate that there are values that will not be
interpreted correctly after the change.

[Field = InvertOrigin]
short = invertorg
type = B
usage = Invert the signs of the X, Y, and Z origin values
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive INVERTORG)  Invert the signs of the X, Y, and Z origin
values to switch the header between different definitions of the origin.

[Field = SetMinMaxMean]
short = setmmm
type = FT
usage = Set the minimum, maximum, and mean densities directly with the
given values
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive SETMMM)  Set the minimum, maximum, and mean densities
directly with the given values.

[Field = RealMode]
short = real
type = B
usage = Change a mode 4 FFT file to mode 2 and double the X size
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive REAL)  Change a mode 4 FFT file to mode 2 and double the X size.

[Field = ComplexMode]
short = fft
type = B
usage = Change a mode 2 file to mode 4 and divide the X size by 2; this can be
done only if the X size is two times an odd number
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive FFT)  Change a mode 2 file to mode 4 and divide the X
size by 2; this can be done only if the X size is two times an odd number.

[Field = SpaceGroup]
short = ispg
type = I
usage = Change the space group entry (0 stack, 1 volume, 401 multiple volumes)
tooltip = 
manpage = (Interactive ISPG)  Change the space group entry, which should be 0
for an image stack, 1 for an image volume, and 401 for a stack with multiple
volumes.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
