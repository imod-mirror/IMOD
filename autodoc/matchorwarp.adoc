[Field = InputVolume]
short = inputvolume

usage = Input file to be transformed
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file to be transformed.  If this option is not entered, the
first nonoption argument is taken as the input volume.

[Field = OutputVolume]
short = outputvolume
type = FN
usage = Transformed output file
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of transformed file to be produced.  If this option is not entered, the
second nonoption argument is taken as this name.

[Field = SizeXYZorVolume]

the entry can be either the name of that file or its NX,NY,NZ dimensions.

[Field = RefineLimit]
short = refinelimit
type = F
usage = Mean residual limit for using refinematch and matchvol (default 0.3)

Refinematch(1) and Matchvol(1).

[Field = WarpLimits]

warp (default 0.2,0.27,0.35)

automatically.  Values should be in increasing order and separated by commas.

[Field = StructureCriteria]
short = structurecrit
type = CH
usage = Criterion values for selecting patches based on a structure measure
tooltip =
manpage = A list of one or more criterion values for selecting patches based
on a measure of structure contained in the patch file.  Both Refinematch(1)
and Findwarp(1) will be run with these limits for selecting patches with the
structure value greater than the criterion.  In Findwarp(1), each criterion
will be applied at a mean residual limit before going on to the next residual
limit.  The measure of structure will be the fraction of analyzed boxes within
a patch with a standard deviation indicative of a strong structure, which is
saved in the patch file by Corrsearch3d(1) as an extra column with ID 5.

[Field = ExtentToFit]

in fits.

patch.out). 

[Field = SolveFile]
short = solvefile
type = FN
usage = Initial transform file (default solve.xf)
tooltip =

volumes (default solve.xf).

tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Warpvol(1) will place the inverse warping 
transformations (default warp.xf).


[Field = ResidualFile]
short = residualfile
type = FN
usage = Output file for patch displacements with residuals
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Refinematch(1) and/or Warpvol(1) will place a new
list of the patches, their displacements, and the residual from the fits.

[Field = VectorModel]
short = vectormodel
type = FN
usage = Output file for model of patches with residuals
tooltip =
manpage = Name of patch vector model file to create from the residual file with 
Patch2imod(1).
