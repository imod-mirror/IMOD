[Field = TomogramFile]
short = tomo
type = FNM
usage = Name of image file to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of image file to analyze.  At least one image file must be
entered either with this option or as a non-option argument.  All non-option
arguments are taken to be tomograms for analysis.

[Field = SurfaceModel]
short = surface
type = FN
usage = File name for output of surface model for flattening
tooltip = 
manpage = File name for output of a surface model that can be used for
flattening in Flattenwarp(1).

[Field = TomoPitchModel]
short = pitch
type = FN
usage = File name for output of boundary model for use with Tomopitch
tooltip = 
manpage = File name for output of boundary model for use with Tomopitch(1).  Such
a model will have two straight lines at each sample position.  If multiple
tomograms are analyzed, each is assumed to be a separate sample, and there
will be a pair of lines for each sample, with the contours assigned to times
corresponding to the sample number.  If there is only a single tomogram,
then the \fB-samples\fR option must be entered to indicate how many regions in
Y to sample.

[Field = SeparatePitchLineFits]
short = separate
type = B
usage = Fit each surface separately in making lines for Tomopitch output
tooltip = 
manpage = When making a model of paired lines for use in Tomopitch(1), the
default is to fit a pair of parallel lines to the top and bottom surfaces.
With this option, lines will be fit separately to points on each surface.
This method would be suitable if every sample has material across a wide
enough area so that the fit will not be thrown off by a few aberrant points.

[Field = NumberOfSamples]
short = samples
type = I
usage = Number of positions to sample in a single tomogram for pitch lines
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of positions to sample in a single tomogram to obtain lines
for Tomopitch(1).  The position and spacing between these samples is
determined by their number, the sample extent, and the total number of
blocks of analyzed boxes in Y.

[Field = SampleExtentInY]
short = extent
type = I
usage = Approximate extent in Y to use at each sample position, in unbinned
pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = Approximate extent in Y analyzed at sampled positions from a single
tomogram, in unbinned pixels.  Since a surface position is estimated only for
each block of boxes, spanning 100 unbinned pixels by default, the actual
extent included in the analysis will be based on an integral number of blocks.
The default is to analyze one block at each sample position.  When multiple
tomogram samples are analyzed, all of the available positions will be used.

[Field = NumberOfDefaultScales]
short = scales
type = I
usage = Number of default, isotropic binnings to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to specify a how many default binnings to
analyze, instead of entering each one with the \fB-binning\fR option.  These
binnings are isotropic (the same in each dimension).  The default binnings
available are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64.  The default is to
do a single scale at binning 1.

[Field = BinningInXYZ]
short = binning
type = ITM
usage = Binning in X, Y, and Z for each scale to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning in X, Y, and Z for each scale to analyze.  Multiple binning
entries should be in order by increased binning.  This option
cannot be entered with \fB-scale\fR.

[Field = SizeOfBoxesInXYZ]
short = size
type = ITM
usage = Size in X, Y, and Z of boxes in which to measure mean and SD
tooltip = 
manpage = Size in X, Y, and Z of boxes in which to measure mean and SD, in
binned pixels.  This option can be entered multiple times, up to once
per each scaling, but one entry seems to be sufficient.  For scalings past the
last one for which a size was entered, the size in each dimension will be set
to span about the same extent in unbinned pixels as for the last binning
for which size was entered. The entry is required.

[Field = SpacingInXYZ]
short = spacing
type = ITM
usage = Spacing in X, Y, and Z between boxes, in binned pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = Spacing in X, Y, and Z between boxes, in binned pixels.  This option
can be entered multiple times, only once, or not at all; the default is to
set the spacing to half of the size.  For scalings past the last one for which
a spacing was entered, the spacing in each dimension will be set to give the
same overlap between boxes as for the last binning for which a spacing was
entered.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum X coordinate to include in analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum X coordinate to include in the analysis.  The
default is to trim off 2.5% of the extent on each end when outputting a
surface model, otherwise 5%.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum Y coordinate to include in analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum Y coordinate to include in the analysis.
If Y is the thickness dimension, the default is to use the whole extent;
otherwise the default is to trim off either 2.5% or 5% of the
extent on each end, depending on whether a surface model is being made.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum Z coordinate to include in analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum Z coordinate to include in the analysis.
If Z is the thickness dimension, the default is to use the whole extent;
otherwise the default is to trim off either 2.5% or 5% of the
extent on each end, depending on whether a surface model is being made.

[Field = ThickDimensionIsY]
short = flipped
type = I
usage = 0 or 1 if the thickness dimension of the reconstruction is Z or Y
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to specify which axis of a single tomogram
is the thickness dimension, if necessary.  The default is to assume that the
shortest dimension of Y or Z is the thickness dimension.  Multiple tomograms
are assumed to be samples as built by Tilt(1) and must have their thickness in
Y.

[Field = EdgeExtentInXYZ]
short = edge
type = IT
usage = Approximate # of pixels in X, Y, and Z to use for edge statistics
tooltip = 
manpage = Approximate # of pixels in X, Y, and Z to use for getting statistics
about the edge of the volume in the thickness dimension.  The default is to
use 2.5% of the extent in the thickness dimension and 50% of the extent in the
other two dimensions.

[Field = CenterExtentInXYZ]
short = center
type = IT
usage = Approximate # of pixels in X, Y, and Z to use for center statistics
tooltip = 
manpage = Approximate # of pixels in X, Y, and Z to use for getting statistics
about the center of the volume.  The default is to use 10% of the extent in
the thickness dimension and 33% of the extent in the other two dimensions.

short = control
type = FPM
usage = Parameter number and value for setting algorithm control parameters

short = volume
type = CH
usage = Root name for output of mean and SD volumes at each scale
tooltip = 
manpage = Root name for output of mean and SD volumes at each scale.  Each
pixel in such volumes corresponds to an individual box within which mean and
