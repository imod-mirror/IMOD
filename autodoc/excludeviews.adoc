[Field = StackName]
short = stack
type = FN
usage = Name of image stack (rootname and extension)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of the image stack to operate on, from which a rootname and
extension can be derived.  However, if restoring with the \fB-orig\fR option,
this should be the rootname and extension without the "_orig".  This is a
required entry; if it is not entered with this option is not entered, the
first non-option argument will be taken as the image stack name.

[Field = ViewsToExclude]
short = views
type = LI
usage = List of views to exclude, numbered from 1
tooltip = 
manpage = List of views to exclude, numbered from 1.  This entry is required
unless \fB-restore\fR is entered.  When restoring a stack,
it is not necessary to enter the view list, and it is better not to, if an
info file is present from when the views were first excluded.  However, if
there is no info file, a view list is needed; this would be the original list
of views given for the exclusion.

[Field = MontagedImages]
short = montage
type = B
usage = Image stack contains montaged images
tooltip = 
manpage = The image stack consists of montaged images.  If this option is not
entered, the program will detect whether a file is a montage automatically, if
the piece coordinates are contained in the header
of an MRC file, the attributes of an HDF file, or an associated ".mdoc" file
(one whose name consists of the stack name plus ".mdoc").  Thus, this entry is
not needed unless the piece coordinates are contained only in a piece list
file.  It is also not needed when restoring a stack if there is an info file
present.

[Field = DeleteOldFiles]
short = delete
type = B
usage = Delete existing stack file(s) rather than keeping them
tooltip = 
manpage = Delete the redundant image and associated files after an operation
is successfully completed instead of retaining them.  Specifically, after
excluding views, the original image stack and any associated files that are
replaced are renamed with "_allviews#" by default (where "#" is the iteration 
number), and will be deleted with this option.  After restoring excluded
views, the existing files are renamed with "_keptviews#" by default; whereas
with this option, both these files and the ones for excluded views named
with "_cutviews#" will be deleted.

[Field = RestoreFullStack]
short = restore
type = B
usage = Combine removed and retained views to restore full stack
tooltip = 
manpage = Combine retained views in the current stack file with excluded views
in the latest "_cutviews#" file to restore the full stack present before the
last iteration.  If an info file is present, the \fB-views\fR and
\fB-montage\fR options should not be entered.  If \fB-views\fR is entered, the
info file is ignored and \fB-montage\fR will be needed if piece coordinates
are only in a piece list file.  If multiple iterations of exclusion have been
run, the program needs to be run with this option that number of times to get
back to a stack with all of the original views.

[Field = OriginalStack]
short = orig
type = B
usage = Restore excluded views into original stack (setname_orig.ext)
tooltip = 
manpage = Restore excluded views into the original stack before X-ray removal.
By default, the current file entered with \fB-stack\fR will be combined with
the excluded views; with this option, the original file "rootname_orig.ext"
will be combined with the excluded views and the combined file will be given
that name.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Print process ID
