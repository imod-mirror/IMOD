[Field = RootName]
short = name
type = CH
usage =  Root name of dataset, excluding a and b
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = MatchAtoB]
short = atob
type = B
usage = Match A to B instead of B to A
tooltip =

[Field = BinningToApply]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning to use for analysis (default brings size to 512-1023)
tooltip = 
manpage = Amount to bin reconstructions for reprojection and patch
correlations.  The default is to bin by an amount up to 4 that brings the
smallest dimension (in the plane of the section) to between 512 and 1023.

[Field = TiltAngleMaxAndStep]
short = tilt
type = FP
usage = Maximum tilt angle to reproject, and step between angles (default 4, 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum tilt angle to reproject and the increment between angles.
The default is 4 and 2.  If the best matching pair of reprojections is at the
end of this tilt range, the program will reproject again with the same range
and step size but centered on the best pair of views, then repeat the tilt
matching.  This process will be repeated up to 2 times, allowing a maximum
tilt angle of 10 degrees by default.  If is necessary to allow a larger range,
it is more efficient use a larger increment as well, and increase the number
of refinement cycles with the \fB-refine\fR option.

[Field = RefineTiltAngles]
short = refine
type = I
usage = Number of times to refine tilt angle estimates (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of times to refine tilt angle estimates.  On each cycle of
refinement, the step size will be cut by two, and new
reprojections made centered at the previous best (uninterpolated) tilt angles.
The angular range will also be cut by 2, unless there were fewer than 5 tilts
reprojected in the original range.

[Field = CenterShiftLimit]
short = center
type = F
usage =  Maximum shift in Z between tomograms at central patch
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum shift in Z between tomograms at the patch nearest the center.
This shift is obtained from the residual of the of that patch in the
Refinematch(1) fit
greater than the -maxresid entry.  If the shift is greater than the limit,
the program will exit with an
error so that an appropriate entry for the initial shift can be made before
doing patch correlations.
The default value is 10.  A value of 0 disables the test.

[Field = MaximumResidual]
short = maxresid
type = F
usage = Largest allowed mean residual from Refinematch, in unbinned pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = The limiting value for the mean residual from running
Refinematch(1).  The reported mean residual will be scaled by the binning and
compared with this value, which should be entered in unbinned pixels.  When
the mean residual is too high, the program will discard the 3D transformation
from Refinematch(1) and use the initial estimate based on the tilt matching. 
It will rerun Corrsearch3d(1) with one very large central patch to modify
the shifts in this transformation.

[Field = ScanRotationMaxAndStep]
short = scan
type = FP
usage = Maximum angle and step size to scan for best rotation, or one angle and 0
tooltip =
manpage = Either the maximum angle and angular step size at which to apply
rotation in order to estimate the best rotation; or a single rotation angle to
apply and a 0 step size; or 0,0 for no rotation scan.  This entry is passed
directly to Matchrotpairs(1).  The default is 20, 4.

[Field = FinalOutputFile]
short = final
type = FN
usage = Name for output file with final 3D transformation (default solve.xf)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
type = I
usage = 1 for all output from some programs, 2 or 3 to save temporary files
tooltip = 
manpage = 1 to print out all output from Matchrotpairs(1) and Refinematch(1),
2 to save large temporary files created locally by this script in addition, or
3 to have Matchrotpairs(1) leave its temporary files in the temporray
directory that is uses.
