[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Root name of dataset, including a or b if dual axis (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Root name of dataset.  For one axis of a dual-axis data set,
include the "a" or "b" in this name.  This option is required.

[Field = VolumeModeled]
short = volume
type = FN
usage = Volume that was modeled or on which points were picked (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the volume in which points were selected.  If a model file
is supplied, this should be the volume that was modeled.  If a point
coordinate file is supplied, the coordinates must correspond to pixel
positions in this file.  This option is required.

[Field = CenterPositionFile]
short = center
type = FN
usage = Name of IMOD model or text file with centers of subvolumes (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of an IMOD model file or a point coordinate file with the center
positions of the desired subvolumes.  A point coordinate file should have one
point per line, with its X, Y, and Z coordinates separated by spaces, not
commas.  These coordinates should correspond to pixels in the full file
specified with \fB-volume\fR, where the first pixel in any dimension spans
coordinates from 0 to 1. This option is required. 

[Field = ObjectsToUse]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of model objects with desired point positions
tooltip =
manpage = If only a subset of objects in the model contain points to be
reconstructed, this option can be used to enter a list of those objects
(comma-separated ranges are allowed).

[Field = SizeInXYZ]
short = size
type = IT
usage = Final size of subvolumes in X, Y, and Z (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Final size of subvolumes in X, Y, and Z.  If the modeled volume was
reoriented by rotation or flipping, subvolumes will be treated similarly, and
this entry specifies the size after reorienting.  This option is required.

[Field = DirectoryForOutput]
short = dir
type = FN
usage = Name of directory to place subvolumes into
tooltip =
manpage = Name of directory to place subvolumes into.  By default, the
subvolumes will be written into the dataset directory; this option can be used
to place them in a subdirectory or, in fact, in a directory located anywhere.
If the directory does not exist yet, it will be created.

[Field = CommandFile]
short = com
type = FN
usage = Starting command file for running Tilt (default tilt.com)
tooltip =
manpage = Starting command file for running Tilt to make the reconstructions.  The
default is to use "tilt.com", so this option is needed for a dual-axis data
set or to use a copy of the file.

[Field = ReorientionType]
short = reorient
type = I
usage = -1, 1, or 0 if volume was reoriented by rotation around X, swapping Y
and Z, or not at all
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to specify the type of reorientation that
was applied to the original reconstruction to obtain the modeled volume, in
the unlikely event that the program cannot detect which was used.
Reorientation by rotation around the X axis can be detected by the tilt
angles in the volume header; swapping of Y and Z can be detected
only if the "clip: flipyz" title is still present.  If necessary, the program
will assume that swapping occurred if the Y dimension is more than twice the Z
dimension, or that no reorientation occurred if the Z dimension is more than
twice the Y dimension.  If the program makes a wrong assumption or insists
that this option be used, enter a 0 for no reorientation, 1 for swapping of Y
and Z, or -1 for rotation around X.
