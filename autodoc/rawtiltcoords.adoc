[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Root name of dataset, including a or b if dual axis (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Root name of dataset.  For one axis of a dual-axis data set,
include the "a" or "b" in this name.  This option is required.

[Field = VolumeModeled]
short = volume
type = FN
usage = Volume that was modeled or on which points were picked (required)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the volume in which points were selected.  If a model file
is supplied, this should be the volume that was modeled.  If a point
coordinate file is supplied, the coordinates must correspond to pixel
positions in this file.  This option is required.

[Field = CenterPositionFile]
short = center
type = FN
usage = Name of IMOD model or text file with desired center positions
tooltip =
manpage = Name of an IMOD model file or a point coordinate file with the
desired center positions in the modeled volume.  A point coordinate file
should have one point per line, with its X, Y, and Z coordinates separated by
spaces, not commas.  These coordinates should correspond to pixels in the full
file specified with \fB-volume\fR, where the first pixel in any dimension
spans coordinates from 0 to 1. This option is required. 

[Field = ObjectsToUse]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of model objects with desired point positions
tooltip =
manpage = If only a subset of objects in the model contain points of interest,
this option can be used to enter a list of those objects
(comma-separated ranges are allowed).

[Field = OutputModel]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Name of output model with positions in raw tilt series
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model with positions in raw tilt series.  If this
option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be taken as the
output model name.

[Field = AngleOutputFile]
short = angle
type = FN
usage = Name of text file for output of projection angles at each position
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of text file to receive a list of the projection angles at each
position in the tilt series, as well as defocus values if the \fI-defocus\fR
option is entered.  This file is produced by Tilt(1); see the corresponding
option in that man page for a full description of the output.

[Field = DefocusFile]
short = defocus
type = FN
usage = File with list of defocus values, or root name of ctfphaseflip file
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the file of project angles specified by
\fI-angle\fR will also have defocus values for each point.  The entry must be
one of two forms: either the file name of a file with a list of defocus
values in nanometers, one per line, underfocus positive; or the root name of
.com and .log files for a run of Ctfphaseflip(1).  In the latter case,
typically the entry will just be "ctfcorrection", with "a" or "b" added if
necessary.  The program will read the .com file to determine the pixel size
used for CTF correction, and whether tilt angles were inverted; and it will
read the .log file to find the defocus values for each view.

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixel
type = F
usage = Pixel size of raw stack
tooltip = 
manpage = The pixel size of the raw stack; this entry is needed only when
entering a defocus file that is a list of defocus values, and only if the
pixel size in the aligned stack is not correct.

[Field = InvertTiltAngles]
short = invert
type = B
usage = Invert tilt angles for defocus computations
tooltip = 
manpage = Invert tilt angles for defocus computations; this entry is needed 
only when entering a defocus file that is a list of defocus values.

[Field = FullReconstruction]
short = full
type = CH
usage = Name of full original reconstruction (default rootname_full.rec)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of full original reconstruction.  The default is
"rootname_full.rec", so this entry is needed if that file does not exists or if
the reconstruction has a different name.  Only the header is read from this
file.

[Field = AlignedStack]
short = ali
type = CH
usage = Name of aligned stack file (default rootname.ali) 
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of aligned stack file.  The default is "rootname.ali", so this
entry is needed if that file does not exists or if the aligned stack has a
different name.  Only the header is read from this file.

[Field = CommandFile]
short = com
type = FN
usage = Tilt command file used to make the reconstruction (default tilt.com)
tooltip = 
manpage = Tilt command file used to make the reconstruction. The
default is to use "tilt.com", so this option is needed for a dual-axis data
set or to use a copy of the file.

[Field = ReorientionType]
short = reorient
type = I
usage = -1, 1, or 0 if volume was reoriented by rotation around X, swapping Y
and Z, or not at all
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to specify the type of reorientation that
was applied to the original reconstruction to obtain the modeled volume, in
the unlikely event that the program cannot detect which was used.
Reorientation by rotation around the X axis can be detected by the tilt
angles in the volume header; swapping of Y and Z can be detected
only if the "clip: flipyz" title is still present.  If necessary, the program
will assume that swapping occurred if the Y dimension is more than twice the Z
dimension, or that no reorientation occurred if the Z dimension is more than
twice the Y dimension.  If the program makes a wrong assumption or insists
that this option be used, enter a 0 for no reorientation, 1 for swapping of Y
and Z, or -1 for rotation around X.
