[Field = AImageFile]
short = ia
type = FN
usage = Name of image file A
tooltip =
manpage = Name of image file A. If this option is not entered, the first
non-option argument will be taken as this name.

[Field = BImageFile]
short = ib
type = FN
usage = Name of image file B
tooltip =
manpage = Name of image file B. If this option is not entered, the second
non-option argument will be taken as this name.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Name of output transform file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of output transform file. If this option is not entered, the third
non-option argument will be taken as this name.

[Field = AStartingEndingViews]
short = za
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending views to search from A
tooltip =
manpage = The starting and ending sections from the first input file to include in the
search, numbered from 1.  The default is to use all sections from the first
file.

[Field = BStartingEndingViews]
short = zb
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending views to search from B
tooltip =
manpage = The starting and ending sections from the second input file to include in the
search, numbered from 1.  The default is to use all sections from the second
file.  Note that the two tilt series can be placed in the
same file, that file name can be given for both input files, and the 
\fB-za\fR and \fB-zb\fR options can be used to indicate where the two tilt
series are in the file.

[Field = SwapAandB]
short = swap
type = B
usage = Swap A and B in the processing to get a transformation from B to A
tooltip =
manpage = Swap A and B in the processing to get a transformation from B to A;
otherwise the output transform aligns an image in A to one in B.

[Field = AngleOfRotation]
short = a
type = I
usage = Rotation direction or angle to search (+1, -1, +90, -90
all work, default is to search both directions)
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to specify the direction of rotation from the first to the
second axis.  Only the sign of this number matters, so you can enter -1 or -90
for clockwise rotations, or 1 or 90 for counterclockwise rotations.  In the
absence of this option, the program will consider both directions of rotation.

[Field = MirrorXaxis]
short = mirror
type = B
usage = Mirror one image around X axis
tooltip =
manpage = Mirror one image around the X axis before rotating by 90 degrees.

[Field = DistortionFile]
short = d
type = FN
usage = Name of (zero-stretch) distortion field file to apply
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with zero-stretch image distortion field from Finddistort(1).

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = b
type = I
usage = Binning of images, needed if undistorting images
tooltip =
manpage = The binning at which images were acquired, which usually needs to be
specified when undistorting.

[Field = RunMidas]
short = m
type = B
usage = Run Midas to set initial translational/rotational alignment
tooltip =
manpage = Run Midas on the first pair of views, and use the alignment that you set in
Midas as the initial alignment for all pairs of views that are considered.
A correction for stretch will be applied in the initial alignment of the other
pairs and may be needed in some cases.

[Field = ScanRotationMaxAndStep]
short = scan
type = FP
usage = Maximum angle and step size to scan for best rotation, or one angle and 0
tooltip =
manpage = Either the maximum angle and angular step size at which to apply
rotation in order to estimate the best rotation; or a single rotation angle to
apply and a 0 step size; or 0,0 for no rotation scan (legacy behavior).  In
the latter case, or when the rotation scan finds the best rotation at the end
the range, an initial run of Xfsimplex(1) will be done to search for
rotation/translation only.  The default is 20 and 4, which will accommodate
inaccuracies in 90-degree rotation of up to ~22 degrees, and give fairly
accurate interpolated rotation values that allow the first Xfsimplex(1) step to
be skipped.

[Field = NearestNeighbor]
short = nearest
type = B
usage = Use nearest neighbor instead of linear interpolation in Xfsimplex
tooltip =
manpage = Use nearest neighbor instead of linear interpolation in
Xfsimplex(1).  This option will trigger other changes in program behavior that
are appropriate when it is not being used for analyzing stretch.

[Field = WriteAllTransforms]
short = x
type = B
usage = Write out the transformations between all pairs of sections
tooltip =
manpage = Write out the transformations between all pairs of sections; a
separate file will be written for each view in B containing the
transformations that align each view in A to that view in B as a reference.

[Field = LeaveTempFiles]
short = t
type = B
usage = Leave temporary files in temporary directory
tooltip =
manpage = For diagnosing problems, leave temporary files in the standard
temporary directory (/usr/tmp, /tmp, or defined by IMOD_TMPDIR) or in the
current directory if there is no temporary directory.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Print process ID
tooltip =
manpage =
