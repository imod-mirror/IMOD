points

points, used to provide the entry to Solvematch for ACorrespondenceList.

used to provide the entry to Solvematch for BCorrespondenceList.

[Field = TransferPointFile]
short = transfer
type = FN
usage = File with matching fiducial coordinates from transferfid
tooltip =
manpage = File of matching fiducial coordinates produced by running 
transferfid with the -c option.

manpage =

[Field = SurfaceModelType]
short = surfaces
type = I
usage = -2 to 2 indicating fiducial distribution and matching model use
tooltip =
manpage = This entry provides the SurfacesOrUseModels entry for Solvematch.
Enter 0 to use matching models and fiducials if any, 2 for
fiducials distributed in Z (e.g. on two surfaces), 1 or -1 for fiducials on
one surface (-1 if tomograms are inverted in Z with respect to each other),
or -2 to use matching models only.

[Field = InitialVolumeMatching]
short = initial
type = B
usage = Get initial transformation with correlations instead of fiducials
tooltip =
manpage = Use Dualvolmatch(1) to find the initial transformation between
volumes by matching reprojections and correlating patches, instead of using
Solvematch(1), which requires fidicial positions or matching models.

[Field = PatchTypeOrXYZ]
short = patchsize
type = CH
usage = S, M, L, E for small, medium, large, extra large patches or size in X,
Y, and Z
tooltip =
manpage = Enter a letter to indicate the size of patches, or three numbers for
the desired size in X, Y, and Z.  The sizes available by letter are S for
small (64x32x64), M for medium (80x40x80), L for large (100x50x100), or E for
extra large (120x60x120).

[Field = AutoPatchFinalSize]
short = autopatch
type = CH
usage = Final patch size for Autopatchfit (S, M, L, E or size in X, Y, Z)
tooltip =
manpage = Enter a final patch size for doing automated patch correlation and
fitting with Autopatchfit(1).  The size can be either a letter to indicate the
size as for the \fB-patchsize\fR option (S, M, L, or E), or three numbers for
the desired size in X, Y, and Z.  The final size may not be smaller than the
initial patch size in any dimension.  Including this option will cause several
changes. Corrsearch3d(1) will use kernel filtering with a default
sigma of 1.45, will analyze local standard deviation and output two measures of
structure in the patch output file, and will eliminate patches with a
structure measure of less than 0.5.  Patches will be more numerous and denser
in X and Y, and usually in Z as well.  In Findwarp(1), fitting will be over a
minimum of 3 patches in X and Y, and thresholds of 0.5,0.57, and 0.65
in the measure of structure are applied successively to eliminate patches at
each residual criterion.  The command file "combine.com" will contain a goto
statement to run Autopatchfit(1) after "matchvol1.com" instead of
"patchcorr.com" then "matchorwarp.com".

[Field = ExtraResidualTargets]
short = extra
type = CH
usage = Extra target residual values for final trial of Autopatchfit
tooltip =
manpage = This option can be used to provide extra target residual values to
be used by Autopatchfit(1) on its final trial.

[Field = XLowerAndUpper]
short = xlimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in X
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in X.  The default
limits exclude a border that varies from 24 pixels for the shorter tomogram
dimension under 1000 pixels to 80 pixels for the shorter tomogram dimension
above 4000 pixels.

[Field = YLowerAndUpper]
short = ylimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Y
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Y.  The default
limits exclude a border that is the same as for the X limits just described.

[Field = ZLowerAndUpper]
short = zlimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Z
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Z.  If the
\fB-autopatch\fR option is entered, the default is the full range in Z (which is
actually the Y dimension of the tomogram).  If not, there is no default and
these limits must be entered.

[Field = PatchRegionModel]
short = regionmod
type = FN
usage = Model with contours enclosing regions to do patch correlations in
tooltip =
manpage = Model with contours enclosing regions to do patch correlations in.
The same model will be supplied to Matchorwarp.

[Field = LowFromBothRadius]
short = lowradius
type = F
usage = Value for the LowFromBothRadius option to Combinefft

[Field = ChangeParametersFile]
short = change
type = FNM
usage = Name of file with directives for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = 'Name of file with directives for changing parameters.  A directive
has the form "comparam.comfile.process.option=value" where "comparam" is a required
prefix for directives to be processed by Setupcombine, "comfile" is the 
name of the command file, "process" is the name of a
program being run on a line starting with "$", "option" is an option to add
or modify, and "value" is its value.  An example is
"comparam.patchcorr.corrsearch3d.KernelSigma=2.5".  Files are processed in order, and
a duplicate entry for an option overrides an earlier one.  Parameters can be
changed only in solvvematch.com and patchcorr.com by this mechanism.'

[Field = OneParameterChange]
short = one
type = CHM
usage = One directive for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = One directive for changing parameters, in the format just described.
Entries with this option are processed after, and can override, ones entered
from files, and later ones override earlier ones.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = FN
usage = Location to create a temporary local directory
tooltip =
manpage = Location to create a temporary local directory.  This directory will
be used for the transformed volumes, the temporary files created during volume
transformations, and the chunks of the combined volume.

[Field = NoTempCleanup]
short = noclean
type = B
usage = Do not clean up the temporary directory when finished
tooltip =
manpage = Do not clean up the temporary directory when finished.  This option
allows you to examine the transformed volume after the operation is
completed.  The default is to remove the temporary directory and its contents
when the combine operation completes.

[Field = InfoOnPatchSizes]
short = info
type = B
usage = List the 4 patch sizes specified by S, M, L, and E and exit
