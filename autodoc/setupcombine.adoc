[Field = RootName]
short = name
type = FN
usage =  Root name of dataset, excluding a and b

[Field = MatchAtoB]
short = atob
type = B
usage = Match A to B instead of B to A
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = ToVolPointList]
short = tolist
type = LI
usage =  List of points in tomogram being matched to that have corresponding 
points
tooltip =
manpage = List of points in tomogram being matched to that have corresponding 
points, used to provide the entry to Solvematch for ACorrespondenceList.

[Field = FromVolPointList]
short = fromlist
type = LI
usage = List of corresponding points in tomogram being transformed to match
tooltip =
manpage = List of corresponding points in tomogram being transformed to match,
used to provide the entry to Solvematch for BCorrespondenceList.

[Field = TransferPointFile]
short = transfer
type = FN
usage = File with matching fiducial coordinates from transferfid
tooltip =
manpage = File of matching fiducial coordinates produced by running 
transferfid with the -c option.

[Field = UsePointList]
short = uselist
type = LI
usage = List of starting points to use from the A axis in Solvematch
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = SurfaceModelType]
short = surfaces
type = I
usage = -2 to 2 indicating fiducial distribution and matching model use
tooltip =
manpage = This entry provides the SurfacesOrUseModels entry for Solvematch.
Enter 0 to use matching models and fiducials if any, 2 for
fiducials distributed in Z (e.g. on two surfaces), 1 or -1 for fiducials on
one surface (-1 if tomograms are inverted in Z with respect to each other),
or -2 to use matching models only.

[Field = PatchTypeOrXYZ]
short = patchsize
type = CH
usage = S, M, L, E for small, medium, large, extra large patches or size in X,
Y, and Z
tooltip =
manpage = Enter a letter to indicate the size of patches, or three numbers for
the desired size in X, Y, and Z.  The sizes available by letter are S for
small (64x32x64), M for medium (80x40x80), L for large (100x50x100), or E for
extra large (120x60x120).

[Field = AutoPatchFinalSize]
short = autopatch
type = CH
usage = Final patch size for Autopatchfit (S, M, L, E or size in X, Y, Z)
tooltip =
manpage = Enter a final patch size for doing automated patch correlation and
fitting with Autopatchfit(1).  The size can be either a letter to indicate the
size as for the \fB-patchsize\fR option (S, M, L, or E), or three numbers for
the desired size in X, Y, and Z.  The final size may not be smaller than the
initial patch size in any dimension.  Including this option will cause several
changes. Corrsearch3d(1) will use kernel filtering with a default
sigma of 1.45, will analyze local standard deviation and output two measures of
structure in the patch output file, and will eliminate patches with a
structure measure of less than 0.5.  Patches will be more numerous and denser
in X and Y, and usually in Z as well.  In Findwarp(1), fitting will be over a
minimum of 3 patches in X and Y, and thresholds of 0.5,0.57, and 0.65
in the measure of structure are applied successively to eliminate patches at
each residual criterion.  The command file "combine.com" will contain a goto
statement to run Autopatchfit(1) after "matchvol1.com" instead of
"patchcorr.com" then "matchorwarp.com".

[Field = ExtraResidualTargets]
short = extra
type = CH
usage = Extra target residual values for final trial of Autopatchfit
tooltip =
manpage = This option can be used to provide extra target residual values to
be be used by Autopatchfit(1) on its final trial.

[Field = XLowerAndUpper]
short = xlimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in X
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in X.  The default
limits exclude a border that varies from 24 pixels for the shorter tomogram
dimension under 1000 pixels to 80 pixels for the shorter tomogram dimension
above 4000 pixels.

[Field = YLowerAndUpper]
short = ylimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Y
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Y.  The default
limits exclude a border that is the same as for the X limits just described.

[Field = ZLowerAndUpper]
short = zlimits
type = IP
usage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Z
tooltip =
manpage = Lower and upper coordinate limits of patches in Z.  If the
\fB-autopatch\fR option is entered, the default is the full range in Z (which is
actually the Y dimension of the tomogram).  If not, there is no default and
these limits must be entered.

[Field = PatchRegionModel]
short = regionmod
type = FN
usage = Model with contours enclosing regions to do patch correlations in
tooltip =
manpage = Model with contours enclosing regions to do patch correlations in.
The same model will be supplied to Matchorwarp.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = FN
usage = Location to create a temporary local directory
tooltip =
manpage = Location to create a temporary local directory.  This directory will
be used for the transformed volumes, the temporary files created during volume
transformations, and the chunks of the combined volume.

[Field = NoTempCleanup]
short = noclean
type = B
usage = Do not clean up the temporary directory when finished
tooltip =
manpage = Do not clean up the temporary directory when finished.  This option
allows you to examine the transformed volume after the operation is
completed.  The default is to remove the temporary directory and its contents
when the combine operation completes.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
