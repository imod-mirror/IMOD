[Field = DirectiveFile]
short = directive
type = FNM
usage = Input file with directives for automating one or more data sets
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with directives for automating one or more data sets.
The filename must end in .adoc.  All non-option arguments will be taken as
such input files.  

[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = FNM
usage = Root name of data set (omit a or b for dual-axis set)
tooltip = 
manpage = A data set name can be provided with this option to override the
name contained in the directive file, thus allowing directive files to be
reused without editing.  If this
option is used, the number of directive files must be either one or the same
as the number of root names.  The current location of the tilt series must be indicated
with the -current option if only one directive file is entered with multiple
root names.

[Field = CurrentLocation]
short = current
type = FNM
usage = Directory where tilt series currently resides
tooltip = 
manpage = Directory where tilt series is currently located.  This entry
overrides the dataset directory contained in the directive file.  It can be
used in two different ways.  If the -deliver option is entered, this option
specifies the directory where a tilt series will be moved from, and it must be
entered either once (if all data sets are in the same place) or once for each
data set.  If the -deliver option is not entered, then this option specifies
the directory where the data set will be processed and must be entered once
for each data set.

[Field = DeliverToDirectory]
short = deliver
type = FN
usage = Make a subdirectory of this directory for each data set
tooltip = 
manpage = Make a subdirectory of the specified directory for each data set,
named with the root name of the data set, and move the tilt series into the
subdirectory.  Several other files with the same root name as the tilt series 
will be moved from the current location of the data set: an associated
metadata file with extension ".mdoc", a log of acquisition with extension
".log", and a file of tilt angles with extension ".rawtlt".  A raw boundary
model for patch tracking or autoseeding will also be delivered.  The -current
option must be entered either once, or once for each data set.

[Field = ProcessOneAxis]
short = one
type = I
usage = 1 to do only A axis, 2 to do only B axis of dual axis data set
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter 1 to do setup and process A axis, or 2 to skip setup and
process only B axis.  This entry applies to all dual-axis data sets being
run.

[Field = CPUMachineList]
short = cpus
type = CH
usage = Machines to use in parallel processing, or number of local cores
tooltip = 
manpage = Machines to use in parallel processing, or number of local cores.
Each machine name can be followed by a ":" (colon), followed by the number of CPUs
to use in that machine; e.g., druid:4,tubule:4.  Prior to IMOD 4.8.25, a "#"
sign was used instead of ":".  Using the "#" sign will now result in a warning 
when entering options on the command line and an error when
entering options through standard input, because in the latter case it cannot
be distinguished from the start of a comment.

[Field = SingleOnFirstCPU]
short = single
type = B
usage = Run single command files on first machine in CPU list
tooltip = 
manpage = Run single command files on the first machine in the CPU list, instead of
on the local machine.  The matchvol and autopatchfit steps in combine are not
affected by this entry; they are always run on the machine with the most CPUs.

[Field = GPUMachineList]
short = gpus
type = CH
usage = Machines to use for parallel processing with a GPU, or 1 for local GPU
tooltip = 
manpage = Machines to use for parallel processing with a GPU, or 1 for local
GPU.  As when running processchunks with the -G option, multiple or specific
GPUs can be specified by colon-separated numbers after a machine name, e.g.,
druid:2,tubule:1:2.

[Field = NiceValue]
short = nice
type = I
usage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs; default is 15
tooltip = 
manpage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs.  Note that this applies
to all computations, not just those run with parallel processing.  The default is 15.

[Field = LimitLocalThreads]
short = limit
type = I
usage = Limit on # of parallel threads to use when running on local machine
tooltip = 
manpage = Limit on the number of threads when running a single command file
on the local machine.  By default, this limit is set
to the number of CPUs on the local machine indicated by the entry to
\fB-cpus\fR.  If that entry consists only of remote machines,
then the program has no information about this limit, and single
command files containing programs parallelized with OpenMP will use all
available cores.  This option allows one to enter a limit in this case, as
well as to set a different limit than the number of CPUs in the CPU list.

[Field = RemoteDirectory]
short = remote
type = FN
usage = Path to starting directory on remote machines
tooltip = 
manpage = Path on remote machines to directory from which this program is started.

[Field = CheckFile]
short = check
type = FN
usage = File to check for quit signals
tooltip = 
manpage = File to check for quit signals.  The default is batchruntomo.###.input
in the directory where this program is started, where ### is the process ID.
The file is passed to processchunks when it runs jobs, and is checked before
and after running jobs.  Only a Q should be placed in this file.  This will
terminate any running jobs and stop all processing.

[Field = EmailAddress]
short = email
type = CH
usage = Address for sending email messages on failure or final completion
tooltip =
manpage = Address for sending email messages either when a set is aborted or
when the run completes.

[Field = ValidationType]
short = validation
type = I
usage = 0/1/2 to validate directives (1/2 to do this then exit), or -1 not to
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, the program will check all directives in the directive
and template files against the master list of directives in
IMOD_DIR/com/directives.csv.  Enter 1 to run the program just to check
a directive file and exit, 2 to check a template file and exit, or -1 to skip
this step.  When checking a directive file, the directive file is first processed to
find certain required values, and an error in that step will prevent the
checking of directives.  Template files referenced by the directive file will
be checked as well.  With an entry of 2, the file will be checked right after
reading.  A batch directive file is required to contain only directives with a
Y in the "Batch" column of the master directives file, and a template file
must contain only directives with a Y in the "Tmplt" column.

[Field = StartingStep]
short = start
type = F
usage = Step to start processing with
tooltip = 
manpage = Step to start processing with: 
^   0: Setup
^   1: Preprocessing
^   2: Cross-correlation alignment
^   3: Prealigned stack
^   4: Patch tracking, autoseeding, or RAPTOR
^   5: Bead tracking
^   7: Positioning
^   8: Aligned stack generation
^   9: CTF plotting
^   10: 3D gold detection
^   11: CTF correction
^   12: Gold erasing after transforming fiducial model or 
^       projecting 3D model
^   13: 2D filtering
^   14: Reconstruction
^   14.5: Postprocessing on a/b axis reconstruction
^   15: Combine setup
^   16: Solvematch
^   17: Initial matchvol
^   18: Autopatchfind
^   19: Volcombine
^   20: Postprocessing
^   Each set will start at this step unless the
\fB-first\fR option is entered, in which case only the first set will start
with this step and others will start from the beginning.  In the latter case,
add 100 to start with this step in
the second axis of a dual-axis data set.  These numbers can be relied on not
to change again since this is now a floating point entry; fractional values
will be used if necessary to insert more steps without renumbering.

[Field = EndingStep]
short = end
type = F
usage = Step to end with
tooltip = 
manpage = Step to end with in each set and axis.  Steps are numbered as
described for \fB-start\fR.  Note that 6 can be used to stop after alignment.

[Field = StartForFirstSetOnly]
short = first
type = B
usage = Skip to starting step only for the first set
tooltip = 
manpage = Skip to starting step only for the first set; the following sets
will be run from the beginning.

[Field = UseExistingAlignment]
short = use
type = B
usage = Use existing fine alignment without rerunning Tiltalign
tooltip =
manpage = Use existing fine alignment without rerunning Tiltalign.
Ordinarily, whenever the \fB-start\fR option is used and the program will be
running any steps that involve the aligned stack or reconstruction, it reruns
Tiltalign(1) iteratively in the usual fashion before proceeding.  This option
can be used to keep the program from
overwriting an alignment based on manually adjusted parameters.  It is allowed
only when starting past step 5.

[Field = ExitOnError]
short = exit
type = B
usage = Exit on error instead of going on to next axis or data set
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = EtomoDebug]
short = etomo
type = I
usage = Run etomo with the given debug level
tooltip =
manpage =
