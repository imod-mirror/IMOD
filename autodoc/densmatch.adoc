[Field = ReferenceFile]
short = reference
long = ReferenceFile
type = FN
usage = Input file with reference volume (the one being matched to)
tooltip =
manpage = Input file with reference volume (the one being matched to).  This
file can be entered on the command line as the first non-option argument.  

[Field = ScaledFile]
short = scaled
long = ScaledFile
type = FN
usage = Input file with volume to be scaled to match
tooltip =
manpage = Input file with volume to be scaled to match.  This
file can be entered on the command line as the second non-option argument, or
as the first non-option argument if \fB-target\fR is entered instead of a
reference file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
long = OutputFile
type = FN
usage = Output file for scaled volume (omit to rewrite input file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for the scaled volume.  This
file can be entered on the command line as the third non-option argument, or
the second non-option argument if \fB-target\fR is entered instead of a
reference file.  If this file is omitted, the
program will write the scaled values back to the input file.

[Field = TargetMeanAndSD]
short = target
type = FP
usage = Mean and SD to scale volume to (omit the reference volume)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mean and standard deviation to scale the volume to (the one entered
with \fB-scaled\fR).  The reference file is not entered in this case.  If you
have a byte or integer image file and you want to scale to a small target SD
value (such as 1, as opposed to 40), then you need to change the mode of the
output file to floating point.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Storage mode of output file; 0 for byte, 1 or 6 for integer, 2 for real
tooltip = 
manpage = The storage mode of the output file; 0 for byte, 1 for 16-bit 
signed integer, 6 for 16-bit unsigned integer, or 2 for 32-bit floating point.
The default is the mode of the input file.  This entry is allowed only when
writing to a new output file.

[Field = ReportOnly]
short = report
long = ReportOnly
type = B
usage = Report scaling factors without writing scaled data to file
tooltip =
manpage = Report scaling factors without writing scaled data to file.  The
program will report two numbers, a factor to multiply by then a constant to
add; these numbers can be supplied to the -multadd option of Newstack.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X coordinates of region to analyze for mean and
SD in reference volume.  An ending X of 0 will be converted to NX - 1, so 0,0
can be entered to use the full extent in X. The default is NX/4, 3*NX/4, where
NX is the size of the scaled volume in X.  X, Y, and Z coordinates are
numbered from 0.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of region to analyze in reference
volume.  An ending Y of 0 will be converted to NY - 1.  The default is NY/4,
3*NY/4, where NY is the size of the scaled volume in Y.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z values of region to analyze in reference
volume.  An ending Z of 0 will be converted to NZ - 1. The default is NZ/4,
3*NZ/4, where NZ is the number of slices in the scaled volume.

[Field = UseAllPixels]
short = all
type = B
usage = Compute mean and SD from all pixels in the files
tooltip = 
manpage = Compute mean and SD from all pixels in the files, not from a sample
of pixels.  With this option, it is not necessary or allowed to enter any minimum and
maximum coordinates.  Use this option to get an exact match to target values
for small volumes (say, several megapixels).  For larger volumes, use "-xm 0,0
-ym 0,0 -zm 0,0" instead to sample the entire volume, unless you really need a precise
match; with sampling, the SD will be accurate to within about 0.2%.

[Field = OffsetRefToScaledXYZ]
short = offset
type = IT
usage = Displacement of scaled volume relative to reference in X, Y, and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Displacement of the volume being scaled relative to the
reference volume in X, Y, and Z;
namely, the amount to add to a pixel coordinate in the reference volume to
obtain the coordinate of the corresponding pixel in the file being scaled.
