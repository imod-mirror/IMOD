[Field = PatchFile]
short = patch
type = FN
usage = Name of input file with positions and displacements
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input file with positions and displacements.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for the input file
name.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for refining transformation (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Optional output file for the refining transformation.  If this
option is not entered, the second non-option argument (if any) will be used
for the output file name.

[Field = RegionModel]
short = region
type = FN
usage = Model file with contours enclosing patches to be included in fit
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with contours enclosing the patches to be included in the
fit

[Field = VolumeOrSizeXYZ]
short = volume
type = FN
usage = Filename or X, Y, Z size of volume being matched to
tooltip = 
manpage = Either the name of the file or the X, Y, and Z dimensions of the
volume being matched to.

[Field = ResidualPatchOutput]
short = residual
type = FN
usage = Output file for patch vectors including residual values
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for positions, displacements, and residual values. If
the patch input file has correlation coefficients, they will be replaced by
the residuals.  

[Field = ReducedVectorOutput]
short = reduced
type = FN
usage = Output file for residual vectors after removing linear component
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for residual vectors from the fit, which represent the
vectors remaining after removing the linear component of the vector field.
These are referred to as reduced vectors.  If the input patch file has
correlation coefficients, they will be passed into this output file; otherwise
the residual values will be placed into the file.

[Field = MeanResidualLimit]
short = limit
type = F
usage = Limiting value for the mean residual
tooltip = 
manpage = Limiting value for the mean residual; above this value, the program
will exit with an error.

[Field = ExtraValueSelection]
short = extra
type = IPM
usage = Extra value ID or -column # and polarity for selecting patches based
on criterion
tooltip =
manpage = Select only patches with extra value on one side of a criterion.
The patch vector file can have additional columns of values after the
displacements in X, Y, and Z.  These extra columns are numbered from 1, and
they may also have ID values on the first line of the file indicating their
type.  To include patches based on values in an extra column, enter two
numbers for this option: the ID value or the negative of the extra column
number; and 1 to select patches above the criterion or -1 to select ones below
it.  You must also enter one or more threshold values with the \fB-select\fR
option.

[Field = SelectionCriteria]
short = select
type = FAM
usage = One or more criteria for selecting patches based on extra values
tooltip =
manpage = One or more criteria for selecting patches based on extra values.
If multiple criteria are entered, the entire autofitting process with will
repeated each selection criterion to try to satisfy the first residual
criterion, then higher residual criteria will be considered.  If there are
multiple values being selected on, this option must
be entered the same number of times as the \fB-extra\fR option and it must
have the same number of criteria entered each time.

[Field = MaxFractionToDrop]
short = maxfrac
type = F
usage = Maximum fraction of patches to eliminate from the fit (default 0.1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum fraction of patches to drop from the fit by outlier 
elimination.  Enter 0 to for no outlier elimination.  The default is 0.1.

[Field = MinResidualToDrop]
short = minresid
type = F
usage = Minimum residual for outlier elimination (default 0.5)
tooltip = 
manpage = The minimum residual for outlier elimination; patches with residuals
smaller than this value will be retained no matter how extreme they are
relative to the other patches.  The default is 0.5.

[Field = CriterionProbabilities]
short = prob
type = FP
usage = Probabilities controlling outlier elimination
tooltip = 
manpage = Two probabilities controlling outlier elimination: a criterion
probability for a patch to be evaluated as an outlier (default 0.01), and
a criterion probability for a patch to be eliminated regardless of the
distribution of extreme values (default 0.002).

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
