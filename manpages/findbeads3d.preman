.SH NAME
findbeads3d - Find spherical densities in a volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
findbeads3d  [options]  input_image_file  output_model_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Findbeads3d will find gold particles and other spherical densities in
tomograms.  Given the diameter of the beads, it will search for particles of
this size and store their locations in a model along with the strengths of
their correlations with an average particle.  It will automatically
determine the threshold strength that separates the gold particles from
lesser densities.
.P
The search occurs in two phases.  First, density is summed over small cubes
centered on each pixel, about 3/8 of the bead diameter on a side, and local
peaks in the summed density are found.  The peak strength is measured by an
integral of the densities relative to the background denisty.  When two of
these candidate peaks are too close together, the weaker one is eliminated.
The integrals are scaled so that they range up to 1, a subset of the
strongest peaks are selected, and an average bead is obtained by extracting
a small volume at each selected peak location.  By default, the subset is
selected by analyzing a histogram of the peak strengths to find a dip
separating the gold from weaker features; however, the -threshold option can
be used to specify a number of peaks to use or a relative peak strength to
use as the threshold.
.P
In the second phase, the average bead is cross-correlated with subvolumes at
all of the candidate peak locations from the first phase.  This time the
value of the cross-correlation (not a normalized correlation coefficient) is
taken as the peak strength, and again they are scaled to range up to 1.  A
selection of the strongest peak locations are then written to the output
model.  Again, the default method for this selection is to analyze a
histogram of peak strengths for a dip between beads and weaker peaks, but
the number of points stored in the model can also be controlled with the
-store option.
.P
The output model consists of a scattered point object with one point per
contour.  The peak strength is stored as a general value, and the object
properties are generally set so that only points above threshold are
displayed.  However, points below threshold generally do exist and need to be
removed before reprojecting the points with Tilt(1).  To see all of the
points, adjust the threshold, or delete points below the threshold, load the
model into 3dmod and open the Bead Fixer in Seed mode.  The Bead Fixer will
have a slider for adjusting the threshold, a checkbox to controlling whether
points below threshold will be displayed, and a button to delete points
below threshold.  Since these points are located on many Z planes, be sure
to check "Delete on all sections" before deleting the points.
.P
The tomogram can be built from binned down aligned images, and the model
will load correctly on an unbinned tomogram.  Also, a reprojection of the
points by Tilt(1) will load correctly on an unbinned or a binned aligned
stack.  Findbeads3d will work much faster on a binned tomogram and may even
work better, as long as the bead size in the binned tomogram is at least 5
pixels.
.P
The tomogram needs to be thicker than normal because the program cannot find
beads too close to the surfaces of the tomogram.  With the typical
elongation taken into account, the program will find only the beads that are
more than ~1.1 bead diameters from the surface.  If gold is on two surfaces,
thickness thus needs to be at least 2.2 bead diameters more than the
average distance between the surfaces, which is indicated in the Surface
Analysis output of Tiltalign(1) as "Thickness at Z intercepts".  To the
extent that beads do not lie exactly in planes, even more thickness will be
required; 3 diameters is a good starting point and is used in the
interface in eTomo.
.P
In IMOD 4.8.30, the program switched to taking the square root of
correlation peak strength.  In a histogram, this change spreads out the
very large histogram peak from weaker, non-bead peaks, compacts and
accentuates the much smaller histogram peak from actual beads, and thus
makes the histogram dip more pronounced and easier to detect.  The
square root values will be reported for the histogram dip and peaks and
stored in the model for visualization in 3dmod.  If a relative peak
strength is entered for the threshold options \-fBthreshold\fR and
\fB-store\fR, it should be in terms of the square root values.
However, the minimum relative peak strength is still entered in terms
of the raw correlation values before taking the square root, in order
to maintain the same behavior for this routinely applied parameter.
.SH OPTIONS
Findbeads3d uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
(without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.
